<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="subhead">A RETURNED TRAVELLER. NEMESIS IN LIVERMORE'S RENTS, 1808.
EXTRAVAGANCE, AND NO CASH. A PAWNED WATCH, AND A RESIDUUM OF
FOURPENCE</p>

<p>An exceptionally well-built man in a blue serge suit walked into a
bank in the City, and, handing his card across the counter, asked if
credit had been wired for him from New York. The clerk to whom he
spoke would inquire.</p>

<p>As he leaned on the counter, waiting for the reply, his appearance
was that of a man just off a sea voyage, wearing a suit of clothes
well knocked about in a short time, but quite untainted by London
dirt. His get-up conveyed no information about his social position
or means. His garments had been made for him; that was all that
could be said. That is something to know. But it leaves the question
open whether their wearer is really only a person in decent
circumstances&mdash;<i>one</i> decent circumstance, at any rate&mdash;or a Duke.</p>

<p>The trustworthy young gentleman in spectacles who came back from an
authority in the bush to tell him that no credit had been wired so
far, did not seem to find any difficulty in affecting confidence
that the ultimate advent of this wire was an intrinsic certainty,
like the post. Scarcely, perhaps, the respectable confidence he
would have shown to a real silk hat&mdash;for the applicant's was mere
soft felt, though it looked new, for that matter&mdash;and a real clean
shirt, one inclusive of its own collar and cuffs. Our friend's
answered this description; but then, it was blue. However, the
confidence would have wavered under an independent collar and
wristbands. Cohesiveness in such a garment means that its wearer may
be an original genius: compositeness may mean that he has to
economize, like us.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 2 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Did you expect it so early as this?" says the trustworthy young
gentleman, smiling sweetly through his spectacles. "It isn't ten
o'clock yet." But he only says this to show his confidence, don't
you see? Because his remark is in its nature meaningless, as there
is no time of day telegrams have a penchant for. No doubt there is a
time&mdash;perhaps even times and half-a-time&mdash;when you cannot send them.
But there is no time when they may not arrive. Except the smallest
hours of the morning, which are too small to count.</p>

<p>"I don't think I did," replies the applicant. "I don't think I
thought about it. I wired them yesterday from Liverpool, when I left
the boat, say four o'clock."</p>

<p>"Ah, then of course it's a little too early. It may not come till
late in the afternoon. It depends on the load on the wires. Could
you call in again&mdash;well, a little before our closing time?"</p>

<p>"All right." The speaker took out a little purse or pocket-book, and
looked in it. "I thought so," said he; "that was my last card." But
the clerk had left it in the inner sanctum. He would get it, and
disappeared to do so. When he came back with it, however, he found
its owner had gone, saying never mind, it didn't matter.</p>

<p>"Chap seems in a great hurry!" said he to his neighbour clerk.
"What's he got that great big ring on his thumb for?" And the other
replying: "Don't you know 'em&mdash;rheumatic rings?" he added: "Doesn't
look a rheumatic customer, anyhow!" And then both of them pinned up
cheques, and made double entries.</p>

<p>The chap didn't seem in a great hurry as he sauntered away along
Cornhill, looking in at the shop-windows. He gave the idea of a chap
with a fine June day before him in London, with a plethora of
choices of what to do and where to go. Also of being keenly
interested in everything, like a chap that had not been in London
for a long time. After watching the action of a noiseless new
petroleum engine longer than its monotonous idea of life seemed to
warrant, he told a hansom to take him to the Tower, for which
service he paid a careless two shillings. The driver showed
discipline, and concealed his emotions. <i>He</i> wasn't going to let out
that it was a double fare, and impair a fountain of wealth for other
charioteers to come. Not he!</p>

<p>The fare enjoyed himself evidently at the Tower. He saw everything

<!-- Page 3 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
he could be admitted to&mdash;the Beauchamp Tower for sixpence, and the
Jewel-house for sixpence. And he gave uncalled-for gratuities. When
he had thoroughly enjoyed all the dungeons and all the
torture-relics, and all the memories of Harrison Ainsworth's
romance, read in youth and never forgotten, he told another hansom
to drive him across the Tower Bridge, and not go too fast.</p>

<p>As he crossed the Bridge he looked at his watch. It was half-past
twelve. He would have time to get back before half-past one to a
restaurant he had made a mental note of near the Bank, and still to
allow the cabby to drive on a bit through the transpontine and
interesting regions of Rotherhithe and Cherry Garden Pier. It was so
unlike anything he had been seeing lately. None the worse for the
latter, in some respects. So, at least, thought the fare.</p>

<p>For he had the good, or ill, fortune to strike on a rich vein of
so-called life in a London slum. Shrieks of fury, terror, pain were
coming out of an archway that led, said an inscription, into
Livermore's Rents, 1808. Public opinion, outside those Rents,
ascribed them to the fact that Salter had been drinking. He was on
to that pore wife of his again, like last week. Half killed her, he
did, then! But he was a bad man to deal with, and public opinion
wouldn't go down that court if I was you.</p>

<p>"But you're not, you see!" said the fare, who had sought this
information. "You stop here, my lad, till I come back." This to the
cabman, who sees him, not without misgivings about a source of
income, plunge into the filthy and degraded throng that is filling
the court, and elbow his way to the scene of excitement.</p>

<p>"<i>He's</i> all right!" said that cabby. "I'll put a tenner on him, any
Sunday morning"&mdash;a figure of speech we cannot explain.</p>

<p>From his elevation above the crowd he can see a good deal of what
goes on, and guess the rest. Of what he hears, no phrase could be
written without blanks few readers could fill in, and for the
meaning of which no equivalent can even be hinted. The actual
substance of the occurrence, that filters through the cries of panic
and of some woman or child, or both, in agony, the brutal bellowings
and threats of a predominant drunken lout, presumably Mr.&nbsp;Salter,
the incessant appeals to God and Christ

<!-- Page 4 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
by terrified women, and the
rhetorical use of the names of both by the men, with the frequent
suggestion that some one else should go for the police&mdash;this actual
substance may be drily stated thus: Mr.&nbsp;Salter, a plumber by trade,
but at present out of work, had given way to ennui, and to relieve
it had for two days past been beating and otherwise maltreating his
daughter, aged fourteen, and had threatened the life of her mother
for endeavouring to protect her. At the moment when he comes into
this story (as a mere passing event we shall soon forget without
regret) he is engaged in the fulfilment of a previous promise to his
unhappy wife&mdash;a promise we cannot transcribe literally, because of
the free employment of a popular adjective (supposed to be a
corruption of "by Our Lady") before or after any part of speech
whatever, as an expletive to drive home meaning to reluctant minds.
It is an expression unwelcome on the drawing-room table. But,
briefly, what Mr.&nbsp;Salter had so sworn to do was to twist his wife's
nose off with his finger and thumb. And he did not seem unlikely to
carry out his threat, as Livermore's tenantry lacked spirit or will
to interpose, and did nothing but shriek in panic when feminine, and
show discretion when masculine; mostly affecting indifference, and
saying they warn't any good, them Salters. The result seemed likely
to turn on whether the victim's back hair would endure the tension
as a fulcrum, or would come rippin' out like so much grarse.</p>

<p>"Let go of her!" half bellows, half shrieks her legal possessor, in
answer to a peremptory summons. "Not for a swiney, soap-eatin'
Apoarstle&mdash;not for a rotten parson's egg, like you. Not for a...."</p>

<p>But the defiance is cut short by a blow like the kick of a horse,
that lands fairly on the eye-socket with a cracking concussion that
can be heard above the tumult, and is followed by a roar of delight
from the male vermin, who see all the joys before them of battle
unshared and dangerless&mdash;the joys bystanders feel in foemen worthy
of each other's steel, and open to be made the subject of wagers.</p>

<p>The fare rejects all offers to hold his coat, but throws his felt
hat to a boy to hold. Self-elected seconds make a kind of show of
getting a clear space. No idea of assisting in the suppression of a
dangerous drunken savage seems to suggest itself&mdash;nothing but

<!-- Page 5 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
what is called "seeing fair." This is, to wit, letting him loose on even
terms on the only man who has had the courage to intervene between
him and his victim. Let us charitably suppose that this is done in
the hope that it means prompt and tremendous punishment before the
arrival of the police. The cabman sees enough from his raised perch
to justify his anticipating this with confidence. He can just
distinguish in the crowd Mr.&nbsp;Salter's first rush for revenge and its
consequences. "He's got it!" is his comment.</p>

<p>Then he hears the voice of his fare ring out clear in a lull&mdash;such a
one as often comes in the tense excitement of a fight. "Give him a
minute.... Now stick him up again!" and then is aware that Mr.
Salter has been replaced on his legs, and is trying to get at his
antagonist, and cannot. "He's playin' with him!" is his comment this
time. But he does not play with him long, for a swift <i>finale</i> comes
to the performance, perhaps consequent on a cry that heralds a
policeman. It causes a splendid excitement in that cabman, who gets
as high as he can, to miss none of it. "That's your sort!" he
shouts, quite wild with delight. "That's the style! Foller on!
Foller on!" And then, subsiding into his seat with intense
satisfaction, "Done his job, anyhow! Hope he'll be out of bed in a
week!"&mdash;the last with an insincere affectation of sympathy for the
defeated combatant.</p>

<p>The fare comes quickly along the court and out at the entry, whose
occupants the cabman flicks aside with his whip suggestively. "Let
the gentleman come, can't you!" he shouts at them. They let him
come. "Be off sharp!" he says to the cabby, who replies, "Right you
are, governor!" and is off, sharp. Only just in time to avoid three
policemen, who dive into Livermore's Rents, and possibly convey Mr.
Salter to the nearest hospital. Of all that this story knows no
more; Mr.&nbsp;Salter goes out of it.</p>

<p>The fare, who seems very little discomposed, speaks through the
little trap to his Jehu. "I never got my new hat again," he says.
"You must drive back; there won't be any decent hatter here."</p>

<p>"Ask your pardon, sir&mdash;the Bridge is histed. Vessel coming
through&mdash;string of vessels with a tug-boat."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, get back to the Bank&mdash;anywhere&mdash;the nearest way you

<!-- Page 6 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
can." And after a mysterious short cut through narrow ways that
recall old London, some still paved with cobbles, past lofty wharves
or warehouses daring men lean from the floors of at dizzy heights,
and capture bales for, that seem afloat in the atmosphere till one
detects the thread that holds them to their crane above&mdash;under
unexplained rialtos and over inexplicable iron incidents in paving
that ring suddenly and waggle underfoot&mdash;the cab finds its way
across London Bridge, and back to a region where you can buy
anything, from penny puzzles to shares in the power of Niagara, if
you can pay for them.</p>

<p>Our cab-fare, when he called out, "Hold hard here!" opposite to a
promising hat-shop, seemed to be in doubt of being able to pay for
something very much cheaper than Niagara. He took out his purse,
still sitting in the cab, and found in it only a sovereign,
apparently. He felt in his pockets. Nothing there beyond five
shillings and some coppers. He could manage well enough&mdash;so his face
and a slight nod seemed to say&mdash;till he went back to the Bank after
lunch. And so, no doubt, he would have done had he been content with
a common human billycock or bowler, like the former one, at
four-and-six. But man is born to give way to temptation in shops. No
doubt you have noticed the curious fact that when you go into a shop
you always spend more&mdash;more than you mean to, more than you want to,
more than you've got&mdash;one or other of them&mdash;but always <i>more</i>.</p>

<p>Inside the shop, billycocks in tissue-paper came out of band-boxes,
and then out of tissue-paper. But, short of eight shillings, they
betrayed a plebeian nature, and lacked charm. Now, those beautiful
white real panamas, at twenty-two shillings, were exactly the thing
for this hot weather, especially the one the fare tried on. His rich
brown hair, that wanted cutting, told well against the warm
straw-white. He looked handsome in it, with those strong cheek-bones
and bronzed throat Mr.&nbsp;Salter would have been so glad to get at. He
paid for it, saying never mind the receipt, and then went out to pay
the cabby, who respectfully hoped he didn't see him any the worse
for that little affair over the water.</p>

<p>"None the worse, thank you! Shan't be sorry for lunch, though."
Then, as he stands with three shillings in his hand, waiting for a
recipient hand to come down from above, he adds: "A

<!-- Page 7 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
very one-sided affair! Did you hear what he said about his
daughter? That was why I finished him so thoroughly."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I did <i>not</i> hear it. But he was good for the gruel he's
got, Lord bless you! without that ... I ask your pardon, sir&mdash;no!
<i>Not</i> from a gentleman like you! Couldn't think of it! Couldn't
<i>think</i> of it!" And with a sudden whip-lash, and a curt hint to his
horse, that cabman drove off unpaid. The other took out a pencil,
and wrote the number of the cab on his blue wristband, close to a
little red spot&mdash;Mr.&nbsp;Salter's blood probably. When he had done this
he turned towards the restaurant he had taken note of. But he seemed
embarrassed about finances&mdash;at least, about the three shillings the
cabby had refused; for he kept them in his hand as if he didn't know
what to do with them. He walked on until he came to a hidden haven
of silence some plane-trees and a Church were enjoying unmolested,
and noticing there a box with a slot, and the word "Contributions"
on it, dropped the three shillings in without more ado, and passed
on. But he had no intention of lunching on the small sum he had
left.</p>

<p>An inquiry of a City policeman guided him to a pawnbroker's shop.
What would the pawnbroker lend him on that&mdash;his watch? Fifteen
shillings would do quite well. That was his reply to an offer to
advance that sum, if he was going to leave the chain as well. It was
worth more, but it would be all safe till he came for it, at any
rate. "You'll find it here, any time up to twelve months," said the
pawnbroker, who also nodded after him knowingly as he left the shop.
"Coming back for it in a week, of course! All of 'em are. Name of
Smith, <i>as</i> usual! Most of 'em are." Yet this man's honouring Mr.
Smith with a comment looked as if he thought him unlike "most of
'em." <i>He</i> never indulged in reflections on the ruck&mdash;be sure of
that!</p>

<p>Mr.&nbsp;Smith, if that was his name, didn't seem uneasy. He found his
way to his restaurant and ordered a very good lunch and a bottle of
Perrier-Jouet&mdash;not a half-bottle; he certainly was extravagant. He
took his time over both, also a nap; then, waking, felt for his
watch and remembered he had pawned it; looked at the clock and
stretched himself, and called for his bill and paid it. Most likely
the wire had come to the Bank by now; anyhow, there was no harm in
walking round to see. If it wasn't there he would go back to the
hotel at Kensington where he

<!-- Page 8 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
had left his luggage, and come back
to-morrow. It was a bore. Perhaps they would let him have a
cheque-book, and save his having to come again. Much of this is
surmise, but a good deal was the substance of remarks made in
fragments of soliloquy. Their maker gave the waiter sixpence and
left the restaurant with three shillings in his pocket, lighting a
cigar as he walked out into the street.</p>

<p>He kept to the narrow ways and little courts, wondering at the odd
corners Time seems to have forgotten about, and Change to have
deserted as unworthy of her notice; every door of every house an
extract from a commercial directory, mixed and made unalphabetical
by the extractor; every square foot of flooring wanted for
Negotiation to stand upon, and Transactions to be carried out over.
No room here for anything else, thought the smoker, as, after a
quarter of an hour's saunter, he threw away the end of his cigar.
But his conclusion was premature. For lo and behold!&mdash;there, in a
strange little wedge-shaped corner, of all things in the world, <i>a
barber's shop</i>; maybe a relic of the days of Ben Jonson or
earlier&mdash;how could a mere loafer tell? Anyhow, his hair wanted
cutting sufficiently to give him an excuse to see the old place
inside. He went in and had his hair cut&mdash;but under special
reservation; not too much! The hairdresser was compliant; but, said
he, regretfully: "You do your 'ed, sir, less than justice." Its
owner took his residuum of change from his pocket, and carelessly
spent all but a few coppers on professional remuneration and a large
bottle of eau-de-Cologne. Perhaps the reflection that he could cab
all the way back to the hotel had something to do with this
easy-going way of courting an empty pocket.</p>

<p>When he got to the Bank another young gentleman, with no spectacles
this time, said <i>he</i> didn't know if any credit was wired. He was
very preoccupied, pinning up cheques and initialling some important
customer's paying-in book. But <i>he</i> would inquire in a moment, if
you would wait. And did so, with no result; merely expression of
abstract certainty that it was sure to come. There was still an
hour&mdash;over an hour&mdash;before closing time, said he to a bag with five
pounds of silver in it, unsympathetically. If you could make it
convenient to look in in an hour, probably we should have received
it. The person addressed

<!-- Page 9 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
but not looked at might do so&mdash;wouldn't
commit himself&mdash;and went away.</p>

<p>The question seemed to be how to while away that hour. Well!&mdash;there
was the Twopenny Tube. At that time it was new, and an excitement.
Our friend had exactly fourpence in his pocket. That would take him
to anywhere and back before the Bank closed. And also he could put
some of that eau-de-Cologne on his face and hands. He had on him
still a sense of the foulness of Livermore's Rents and wanted
something to counteract it. Eau-de-Cologne is a great sweetener.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="subhead">A JOURNEY IN THE TWOPENNY TUBE. A VERY NICE GIRL, AND A NEGOTIATION.
AN EXPOSED WIRE, AND AN ELECTROCUTION</p>

<p>He took his fare in the Twopenny Tube. It was the last twopence but
one that he had in his pocket. Something fascinated him in the idea
of commanding, in exchange for that twopence, the power of alighting
at any point between Cheapside and Shepherd's Bush. Which should it
be?</p>

<p>If he could only make up his mind to <i>not</i> alighting at Chancery
Lane, he would have two whole minutes for consideration. If British
Museum he would have four. If Tottenham Court Road, six&mdash;and so on.
For the time being he was a sort of monarch, in a small way, over
Time and Space. He would go on to the Museum, at any rate.</p>

<p>What little things life hangs on, sometimes! If he had foolishly got
out at either Chancery Lane or British Museum, there either would
have been no reason for writing this story; or, if written, it would
have been quite different. For at the Museum Station a girl got into
the carriage; and, passing him on her way to a central haven of
rest, trod on his foot, with severity. It hurt, so palpably, that
the girl begged his pardon. She was a nice girl, and sorry.</p>

<p>He forgave her because she was a nice girl, with beautiful rows of
teeth and merry eyebrows. He might have forgiven her if she had been
a dowdy. But he liked forgiving those teeth, and those eyebrows.</p>

<p>So when she sat down in the haven, close to his left shoulder, he
wasn't sorry that his remark that <i>he</i> ought to beg <i>her</i> pardon,
because it was all his fault for sticking out, overlapped her coming
to an anchor. If it had been got through quicker, the incident would
have been regarded as closed. As it was, the fag-end of it was
unexhausted, and she didn't quite catch the whole. It was in no way
unnatural that she should turn her head slightly,

<!-- Page 11 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
and say: "I beg
your pardon." Absolute silence would have been almost discourteous,
after plunging on to what might have been a bad corn.</p>

<p>"I only meant it was my fault for jamming up the whole gangway."</p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;but it was my fault all the same&mdash;for&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I beg your pardon? You were going to say&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I mean&mdash;for standing on it so long, then! If you had called
out&mdash;but indeed I didn't think it was a foot. I thought it was
something in the electricity."</p>

<p>Two things were evident. One was that it was perfectly impossible to
be stiff and stodgy over it, and not laugh out. The other, the
obvious absurdity of imputing any sort of motive to the serene
frankness and absolute candour of the speaker. Any sort of
motive&mdash;"of <i>that</i> sort"&mdash;said he to himself, without further
analysis. He threw himself into the laugh, without attempting any.
It disposed of the discussion of the subject, but left matters so
that stolid silence would have been priggish. It seemed to him that
not to say another word would almost have amounted to an insinuation
against the eyebrows and the teeth. He would say one&mdash;a most
impersonal one.</p>

<p>"Do they stop at Bond Street?"</p>

<p>"Do you want to stop at Bond Street?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. I don't care where I stop. I think I meant&mdash;is there a
station at Bond Street?"</p>

<p>"The station wasn't opened at first. But it's open now."</p>

<p>What an irritating thing a conversation can be! Here was this one,
just as one of its constituents was beginning to wish it to go on,
must needs exhaust its subject and confess that artificial
nourishment was needed to sustain it. And she&mdash;(for it was she, not
he:&mdash;did you guess wrong?)&mdash;had begun to want to know, don't you
see, why the man with the hair on the back of his browned hand and
the big plain gold ring on his thumb did not care where he stopped.
If he had had a holiday look about him she might have concluded that
he was seeing London, and then what could be more natural than to
break loose, as it were, in the Twopenny Tube? But in spite of his
leisurely look, he had not in the least the seeming of a
holiday-maker. His clothes were not right for the part. What he was
could

<!-- Page 12 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
not be guessed without a clue, and the conversation had
collapsed, clearly! It was irritating to be gravelled for lack of
matter&mdash;and he was such a perfect stranger! The girl was a reader of
Shakespeare, but she certainly didn't see her way to Rosalind's
little expedient. "Even though my own name <i>is</i> Rosalind," said she
to herself.</p>

<p>It was the readiness and completeness with which the man dropped the
subject, and recoiled into himself, that gave the girl courage to
make an attempt to satisfy her curiosity. When a man harks back,
palpably, on some preoccupation, after exchanging a laugh and an
impersonal word or two with a girl who does not know him, it is the
best confirmation possible of his previous good faith in seeming
more fatherlike than manlike. Rosalind could risk it, surely. "Very
likely he has a daughter my age," said she to herself. Then she saw
an opening&mdash;the thumb-ring.</p>

<p>"Do pray excuse me for asking, but do you find it does good? My
mother was recommended to try one."</p>

<p>"This ring? It hasn't done <i>me</i> any good. But then, I have hardly
anything the matter. I don't know about other people. I'm sorry I
bought it, now. It cost four-and-sixpence, I think. I would sooner
have the four-and-sixpence.... Yes, decidedly! I would sooner have
the four-and-sixpence."</p>

<p>"Can't you sell it?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I could get sixpence for it."</p>

<p>"Do please excuse me&mdash;I mean, excuse the liberty I take&mdash;but I
should so much like to&mdash;to...."</p>

<p>"To buy it for sixpence? Certainly. Why not? Much better than paying
four-and-six for a new one. Your mother <i>may</i> find it do her good. I
don't care about it, and I really have nothing the matter."</p>

<p>He drew the ring off his thumb, and Rosalind took it from him. She
slipped it on her finger, over her glove. Naturally it slipped
off&mdash;a man's thumb-ring! She passed it up inside the glove-palm,
through the little slot above the buttons. Then she got out her
purse, and looked in to see what its resources were.</p>

<p>"I have only got half-a-crown," said she. The man flushed slightly.
Rosalind fancied he was angry, and had supposed she was

<!-- Page 13 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
offering
beyond her bargain, which might have implied liberality, or
benevolence, or something equally offensive. But it wasn't that at
all.</p>

<p>"I have no change," said he. "Never mind about the sixpence. Send me
stamps. I'll give you my card." And then he recollected he had no
card, and said so.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter being very exact," said she.</p>

<p>"I have no money at all. Except twopence."</p>

<p>Rosalind hesitated. This man must be very hard up, only he certainly
did not give that impression. Still, "no money at all, except
twopence!" Would it be safe to try to get the half-crown into his
pocket? That was what she wanted to do, but felt she might easily
blunder over it. If she was to achieve it, she must be quick, for
the public within hearing was already feeling in its pocket, in
order to oblige with change for half-a-crown. She <i>was</i> quick.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> send it <i>me</i> in stamps," she said, pressing the coin on him.
"Take it, and I'll get my card for the address. It will be
one-and-eleven exactly, because of the postage. It ought to be a
penny for stationery, too.... Oh, well! never mind, then...."</p>

<p>She had got the card, and the man, demurring to the stationery
suggestion, and, indeed, hesitating whether to take the coin at all,
looked at the card with a little surprise on his face. He read it:</p>

<div><br /></div>

<div class="card">
<hr class="spacer" />

<p class="center">MRS. NIGHTINGALE.</p>

<p class="center">MISS ROSALIND NIGHTINGALE.</p>

<hr class="spacer" />

<p>KRAKATOA, GLENMOIRA ROAD,</p>

<p class="indl">SHEPHERD'S BUSH, W.</p>
</div>

<div><br /></div>

<p>"I'm not Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale," said the girl. "That's my mother."</p>

<p>"Oh no!" said he. "It wasn't that. It was only that I knew the name
once&mdash;years ago."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 14 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
</div>

<p>The link in the dialogue here was that she had thought the surprise
was due to his crediting her with matrimony and a visiting-card
daughter. She was just thinking could she legitimately inquire into
the previous Nightingale, when he said some more of his own accord,
and saved her the trouble.</p>

<p>"Rosalind Nightingale was the name," said he. "Do you know any
relation&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only my mother," answered the girl, surprised. "She's Rosalind,
too, like me. I mean, <i>I'm</i> Rosalind. I am always called Sally,
though."</p>

<p>The man was going to answer when, as luck would have it, the card
slipped from his fingers and fluttered down. In pursuing it he
missed the half-crown, which the young lady released, fancying he
was about to take hold of it, and stooped to search for it where it
had rolled under the seat.</p>

<p>"How idiotic of me!" said he.</p>

<p>"Next station Uxbridge Road," thus the guard proclaimed; and then,
seeing the exploration that was going on after the half-crown, he
added: "I should let it go at that, mister, if I was you."</p>

<p>The man asked why?</p>

<p>"There was a party tried that game last week. He's in the horspital
now." This was portentous and enigmatical. The guard continued: "If
a party gets electrocuted, it's no concern of the employees on the
line. It lies between such parties and the Company. I shouldn't
myself, if I was you! But it's between you and the Company. I wash
<i>my</i> hands."</p>

<p>"If the wires are properly insulated"&mdash;this was from an important
elderly gentleman, of a species invariable under the
circumstances&mdash;"<i>if</i> the wires are properly insulated, there is not
the slightest cause for apprehension of any sort or kind."</p>

<p>"Very good!" said the guard gloomily. "Then all I say is, insoolate
'em yourselves. Don't try to put it on me! Or else keep your hands
well outside of the circuit." But the elderly gentleman was not
ready to acquiesce in the conditions pointed at.</p>

<p>"I repeat," said he, "that the protection of the public is, or ought
to be, amply secured by the terms of the Company's charter. If any
loophole exists for the escape of the electric current, all

<!-- Page 15 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
I can
say is, the circumstances call for public inquiry. The safety of the
public is the concern of the authorities."</p>

<p>"Then," said the guard pointedly, "if I was the public, I should put
my hands in my pocket, and not go fishing about for ambiguous
property in corners. There!&mdash;what did I tell you? Now you'll say
that was me, I suppose?"</p>

<p>The thing that hadn't been the guard was a sudden crackle that
leaped out in a blue flame under the seat where the man's hand was
exploring for the half-crown. It was either that, or another like
it, at the man's heel. Or both together. A little boy was intensely
delighted, and wanted more of the same sort. The elderly gentleman
turned purple with indignation, and would at once complain to the
authorities. They would take the matter up, he doubted not. It was a
disgrace, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>Rosalind, or Sally, Nightingale showed no alarm. Her merry eyebrows
were as merry as ever, and her smile was as unconscious a frame to
her pearly teeth as ever, when she turned to the mother of the
delighted little boy and spoke.</p>

<p>"There now! It's exactly like that when I comb my hair in very dry
weather." And the good woman was able to confirm this from her own
experience, narrating (with needless details) the strange phenomena
attendant on the head of a young person in quite a good situation at
Woollamses, and really almost a lady, stating several times what she
had said to the young person, Miss Ada Taylor, and what answer she
had received. She treated the matter entirely with reference to the
bearings of the electric current on questions of social status.</p>

<p>But the man did not move, remaining always with his arm under the
seat. Rosalind, or Sally, thought he had run the half-crown home,
but in some fixed corner from which detachment was for a moment
difficult. Wondering why the moment should last so long, she spoke.</p>

<p>"Have you got it?" said she.</p>

<p>But the man spoke never a word, and remained quite still.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="subhead">KRAKATOA VILLA, AND HOW THE ELECTROCUTED TRAVELLER WENT THERE IN A
CAB. A CURIOUS WELCOME TO A PERFECT STRANGER. THE STRANGER'S LABEL.
A CANCELLED MEMORY. BACK LIKE A BAD SHILLING</p>

<p>Krakatoa was a semi-detached villa, a few minutes' walk from
Shepherd's Bush Station. It looked like a showily dressed wife of a
shabby husband; for the semi-detached other villa next door had been
standing to let for years, and its compo front was in a state of
decomposition from past frosts, and its paint was parched and thin
in the glare of the present June sun, and peeling and dripping
spiritlessly from the closed shutters among the dead flies behind
the cracked panes of glass that had quite forgotten the meaning of
whitening and water, and that wouldn't hack out easy by reason of
the putty having gone 'ard. One knew at a glance that if the
turncock was to come, see, and overcome the reluctance of the
allotted cock-to-be-turned, the water would burst out at every pore
of the service-pipes in that house, except the taps; and would know
also that the adept who came to soften their hearts and handles
would have to go back for his tools, and would be a very long time
away.</p>

<p>Krakatoa, on the other hand, was resplendent with stone-colour, and
smelt strongly of it. And its door you could see through the glass
of into the hall, when its shutters were not thumb-screwed up over
the panes, was painted a green that staggered the reason, and smelt
even more strongly than the stone-colour. And all the paint was so
thick that the beadings on the door were dim memories, and all the
execution on the sculptured goblets on pedestals flanking the steps
in the front garden was as good as spoiled. And the paint simmered
in the sun, and here and there it blistered and altogether suggested
that Krakatoa, like St.&nbsp;Nicholas, might have halved its coats with
the beggar next door&mdash;given him, suppose, one flat and one round

<!-- Page 17 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
coat. Also, that either the job had been 'urried, and not giv'
proper time to dry, or that the summer had come too soon, and we
should pay for it later on, you see if we didn't!</p>

<p>The coatless and woe-begone villa next door had almost lost its
name, so faded was the lettering on the gate-post that was putting
out its bell-handle to the passer-by, even as the patient puts out
his tongue to the doctor. But experts in palimpsests, if they had
penetrated the superscriptions in chalk and pencil of idle
authorship, would have found that it was The Retreat. Probably this
would have been revealed even if the texts had been merely
Bowdlerised with Indian-rubber or a sponge, because there were a
good many objectionable passages.</p>

<p>But The Retreat <i>was</i> a retreat, and smelt strong of the Hermits,
who were cats. Krakatoa was not a volcano, except so far as
eruptions on the paint went. But then it had become Krakatoa through
a mistake; for the four coats of paint at the end of the first seven
years, as per agreement, having completely hidden the first name,
Saratoga, and the builders' retention of it having been
feeble&mdash;possibly even affected by newspaper posters, for it was not
long after the date of the great eruption&mdash;the new name had crept in
in the absence of those who could have corrected it, but had gone to
Brighton to get out of the smell of the paint.</p>

<p>When they returned, Mr.&nbsp;Prichard, the builder, though shocked and
hurt at the discovery that the wrong name had been put up, was
strongly opposed to any correction or alteration, especially as it
would always show if altered back. You couldn't make a job of it;
not to say a proper job. Besides, the names were morally the same,
and it was absurd to allow a variation in the letters to impose on
our imagination. The two names had been applied to very different
turns-out abroad, certainly; but then they did all sorts of things
abroad. If Saratoga, why not Krakatoa? Mr.&nbsp;Prichard was entrenched
in a stronghold of total ignorance of literary matters, and his
position, that mere differences of words ought not to tell upon a
healthy mind, was difficult to shake, especially as he had the coign
of vantage. He had only to remain inanimate, and what could a
(presumably) widow lady with one small daughter do against him? So
at the end of the first seven years, what had been Saratoga became
Krakatoa, and remained so.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 18 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
</div>

<p>And it was in the back garden of the again newly painted villa,
seven years later, that the lady of the house, who was watering the
garden in the cool of the afternoon, asked her excited daughter, who
had just come home in a cab, what on earth could have prompted her
to do such a mad thing, such a perfectly <i>insane</i> thing! We shall
see what it was immediately.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sally, Sally!" exclaimed that young person's still young and
very handsome mother. "What <i>will</i> the child do next?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma, mamma!" answers Sally, just on the edge of a burst of
tears; "what <i>was</i> I to do? What <i>could</i> I do? It was all my fault
from the beginning. You <i>know</i> I couldn't leave him to be taken to
the police-station, or the hospital, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course you could! Why not?"</p>

<p>"And not know what became of him, or anything? Oh, mother!"</p>

<p>"You silly child! Why on earth couldn't you leave him to the railway
people?"</p>

<p>"And run away and leave him alone? Oh, <i>mother</i>!"</p>

<p>"But you don't even know his name."</p>

<p>"Mamma, dear, how <i>should</i> I know his name? Don't you see, it was
just like this." And then Miss Sally Nightingale repeats, briefly
and rapidly, for the second time, the circumstances of her interview
in the railway-carriage and its tragic ending. Also their sequel on
the railway platform, with the partial recovery of the stunned or
stupefied man, his inability to speak plainly, the unsuccessful
search in his pockets for something to identify him, and the final
decision to put him in a cab and take him to the workhouse
infirmary, pending discovery of his identity. The end of her story
has a note of relief in it:</p>

<p>"And it was then I saw Dr.&nbsp;Vereker on the platform."</p>

<p>"Oh, you saw Dr.&nbsp;Vereker?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did, and he came with me. He's always so kind, you
know, and he knew the station people, so...."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"Outside in the cab. He stopped to see after the man. We couldn't
both come away, so I came to tell you."</p>

<p>"You stupid chit! why couldn't you tell me at first? There, don't
cry and be a goose!"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 19 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
</div>

<p>But Sally disclaims all intention of crying. Her mother discards the
watering-pot and an apron, and suppresses appearances of gardening;
then goes quickly through the house, passes down the steps between
the scarlet geraniums in the over-painted goblets, through the gate
on which Saratoga ought to be, and Krakatoa is, written, and finds a
four-wheeled cab awaiting developments. One of its occupants alights
and meets her on the pavement. A rapid colloquy ensues in
undertones, ending in the slightly raised voice of the young man,
who is clearly Dr.&nbsp;Vereker.</p>

<p>"Of course, you're perfectly right&mdash;perfectly right. But you'll have
to make my peace with Miss Sally for me."</p>

<p>"A chit of a girl like that! Fancy a responsible man like you
letting himself be twisted round the finger of a young monkey. But
you men are all alike."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, really, what Miss Sally said was quite true&mdash;that
it was only a step out of the way to call here. And she had got this
idea that it was all her fault."</p>

<p>"Was it?"</p>

<p>"I can only go by what she says." The girl comes into the
conversation through the gate. She may perhaps have stopped for a
word or two with cook and a house-and-parlourmaid, who are deeply
interested, in the rear.</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> my fault," she said. "If it hadn't been for me, it would
never have happened. Do see how he is now, Dr.&nbsp;Vereker."</p>

<p>It is open to surmise that the first strong impulse of generosity
having died down under the corrective of a mother, our young lady is
gradually seeing her way to interposing Dr.&nbsp;Vereker as a buffer
between herself and the subject of the conversation, for she does
not go to the cab-door to look in at him. The doctor does. The
mother holds as aloof as possible, not to get entangled into any
obligations.</p>

<p>"Get him away to the infirmary, or the station at once," she says.
"That's the best thing to be done. They'll take care of him till his
friends come to claim him. Of course, they'll come. They always do."
The doctor seems to share this confidence, or affects to do so.</p>

<p>"Sure to. His friends or his servants," says he. "But he can't

<!-- Page 20 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
give
any account of himself yet. Of course, I don't know what he'll be
able to do to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>He resumes his place in the cab beside its occupant, who, except for
an entire want of animation, looks much like what he did in the
railway-carriage&mdash;the same strong-looking man with well-marked
cheek-bones, very thick brown hair and bushy brows, a skin rather
tanned, and a scar on the bridge of the nose; very strong hands with
a tattoo-mark showing on the wrist and an abnormal crop of hair on
the back, running on to the fingers, but flawed by a scar or two.
Add to this the chief thing you would recollect him by, an
Elizabethan beard, and you will have all the particulars about him
that a navy-blue serge suit, with shirt to match, allows to be seen
of him. But you will have an impression that could you see his skin
beyond the sun-mark limit on his hands and neck, you would find it
also tattooed. Yet you would not at once conclude he was a sailor;
rather, your conclusion might go on other lines, but always
assigning to him a rough adventurous outdoor life.</p>

<p>When the doctor got into the cab and shut the door himself, he took
too much for granted. He assumed the driver, without whom, if your
horse has no ambition at all beyond tranquillity and an empty
nosebag, your condition is that of one camping out; or as one in a
ship moored alongside in dock, the kerbstone playing the part of the
quay. Boys will then accumulate, and undervalue your appearance and
belongings. And impossible persons, with no previous or subsequent
existence, will endeavour to see their way to the establishment of a
claim on you. And you will be rather grateful than otherwise that a
policeman without active interests should accrue, and communicate to
them the virus of dispersal, however long its incubation may be. You
will then probably do as Dr.&nbsp;Vereker did, and resent the driver's
disappearance. The boys, mysteriously in his, each other's, and the
policeman's confidence (all to your exclusion), will be able to
quicken his movements, and he will come trooping from the horizon,
on or beyond which is Somebody's Entire.</p>

<p>All this came to pass in due course, and the horse, deprived of his
nosebag, returned to his professional obligations. But it was a
shabby horse in a shabby cab, to which he imparted movement by
falling forwards and saving himself just before he reached

<!-- Page 21 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the
ground. His reins were visibly made good with stout pack-thread, and
he had a well-founded contempt for his whip, which seemed to come to
an end too soon, and always to hit something wooden before it
reached any sensitive part of his person. But he did get off at
last, and showed that, as Force is a mode of motion, so Weakness is
a mode of slowness, and one he took every advantage of.</p>

<p>The mother and daughter stood looking after the vanishing label,
that stated that the complication of inefficiencies in front of it
was one of twelve thousand and odd&mdash;pray Heaven, more competent
ones!&mdash;in the Metropolis, and had nearly turned to go into the
house, when the very much younger sister (that might have been)
addressed the very much, but not impossibly, older one thus:</p>

<p>"Mamma, he said he knew somebody of our name!"</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Fiddlestick!"&mdash;with an implication of what of that? Were
there not plenty of Nightingales in the world? Miss Sally is
perceptive about this.</p>

<p>"Yes, but he said Rosalind."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"He didn't say where. That's all he said&mdash;Rosalind."</p>

<p>As the two stand together watching the retreating cab we are able to
see that our first impression of them, derived perhaps from their
relative ages only, was an entirely false one as far as size went.
The daughter is nearly as tall as her mother, and may end by being
as big a woman when she has completely graduated, taken her degree,
in womanhood. But for all that we, who have looked at both faces,
know that when they turn round we shall see on the shoulders of the
one youth, inexperience, frankness, and expectation of things to
come; on those of the other a head that keeps all the mere physical
freshness of the twenties, if not quite the bloom of the teens,
but&mdash;expressed Heaven knows how!&mdash;experience, reserve, and
retrospect on things that have been once and are not, and that we
have no right to assume to be any concern of ours. Equally true of
all faces of forty, do we understand you to say? Well, we don't know
about that. It was all very strong in this face.</p>

<p>We can look again, when they turn round. But they don't; for number
twelve thousand and odd has come to a standstill, and

<!-- Page 22 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
its
energumenon has come down off its box, and is "fiddlin' at something
on the 'orse's 'ed." So cook says, evidently not impressed with that
cab. The doctor looks out and confers; then gets out and comes back
towards the house. The girl and her mother walk to meet him.</p>

<p>"Never saw such a four-wheeler in my life! The harness is tied up
with string, and the rein's broken. The idiot says if he had a stout
bit of whipcord, he could make it square." No sooner have the words
passed the doctor's lips than Miss Sally is off on a whipcord quest.</p>

<p>"I wish the child wouldn't always be in such a hurry," says her
mother. "Now she won't know where to get it."</p>

<p>She calls after her ineffectually. The doctor suggests that he shall
follow with instructions. Yes, suppose he does? There is precisely
the thing wanted in the left-hand drawer of the table in the
hall&mdash;the drawer the handle comes off. This seems unpromising, but
the doctor goes, and transmission of messages ensues, heard within
the house.</p>

<p>Left alone, Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale, the elder Rosalind, seems reflective.
"A funny thing, too!" she says aloud to herself. She is thinking,
clearly, of how this man in the cab, who can't give any account of
himself, once knew a Rosalind Nightingale.</p>

<p>Probably the handle has come off the drawer, for they are a long
time over that string. Curiosity has time to work, and has so much
effect that the lady seems to determine that, after all, she would
like to see the man. Now that the cab is so far from the door, even
if she spoke to him, she would not stand committed to anything. It
is all settled, arranged, ratified, that he shall go to the
police-station, or the infirmary, "or somewhere."</p>

<p>When the string, and Dr.&nbsp;Vereker, and Sally the daughter come out of
the house, both exclaim. And the surprise they express is that the
mother of the latter should have walked all the way after the cab,
and should be talking to the man in it! It is not consistent with
her previous attitude.</p>

<p>"Now, isn't that like mamma?" says Sally. If so, why be so
astonished at it?&mdash;is a question that suggests itself to her hearer.
But self-confutation is not a disorder for his treatment. Besides,
the doctor likes it, in this case. His own surprise at mamma's
conduct is unqualified by any intimate acquaintance with

<!-- Page 23 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
her
character. She may be inconsistency itself, for anything he knows.</p>

<p>"Is she going to turn the cab round and bring him to the house,
after all?" It looks like it.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," Sally replies to the doctor.</p>

<p>"I hope you won't repent it in sackcloth and ashes."</p>

<p>"I shan't. Why do you think I shall?"</p>

<p>"How do you know you won't?"</p>

<p>"You'll see!" Sally pinches her red lips tight over her two rows of
pearls, and nods confirmation. Her dark eyes look merry under the
merry eyebrows, and the lip-pinch makes a dimple on her chin&mdash;a
dimple to remember her by. She is a taking young lady, there is no
doubt of it. At least, the doctor has none.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sally, it's all quite right." Thus her mother, arriving a
little ahead of the returning cab. "Now, don't dispute with me,
child, but do just as I tell you. We'll have him in the
breakfast-room; there's fewer steps." She seems to have made up her
mind so completely that neither of the others interposes a word. But
she replies, moved by a brain-wave, to a question that stirred in
the doctor's mind.</p>

<p>"Oh yes; he has spoken. He spoke to me just now. I'll tell you
presently. Now let's get him out. No, never mind calling cook. You
take him on that side, doctor.... That's right!"</p>

<p>And then the man, whose name we still do not know, found himself
half supported, half standing alone, on the pavement in front of a
little white eligible residence smelling of new paint. He did not
the least know what had happened. He had only a vague impression
that if some one or something, he couldn't say what, would only give
up hindering him, he would find something he was looking for. But
how could he find it if he didn't know what it was? And that he was
quite in the dark about. The half-crown and the pretty girl who had
given it to him, the train-guard and his cowardice about
responsibility, the public-spirited gentleman, the railway-carriage
itself, to say nothing of all the exciting experiences of the
morning&mdash;all, all had vanished, leaving behind only the trace of the
impulse to search. Nothing else! He stood looking bewildered, then
spoke thickly.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 24 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"I am giving trouble," said he. Then the two ladies and the
gentleman, whom he saw dimly and did not know, looked at one
another, each perhaps to see if one of the others would speak first.
In the end the lady who was a woman nodded to the gentleman to
speak, and then the lady who was a girl confirmed her by what was
little more than an intention to nod, not quite unmixed with a
mischievous enjoyment at the devolution of the duty of speech on the
gentleman. It twinkled in her closed lips. But the gentleman didn't
seem overwhelmed with embarrassment. He spoke as if he was used to
things.</p>

<p>"You have had an accident, sir.... On the railway.... In the
Twopenny Tube.... Yes, you'll remember all about it presently....
Yes, I'm a doctor.... Yes, we want you to come in and sit down and
rest till you're better.... No, it won't be a long job. <i>You'll</i>
soon come round.... What?... Oh no, no trouble at all! It's this
lady's house, and she wants you to come in." The speaker seems to
guess at the right meanings, as one guesses in the jaws of the
telephone, perhaps with more confidence. But there was but little
audible articulation on the other's part.</p>

<p>He seemed not to want much support&mdash;chiefly guidance. He was taken
down the half-dozen steps that flanked a grass slope down to a stone
paving, and through a door under the more numerous steps he had
escaped climbing, and into a breakfast-room flush with the kitchen,
opening on a small garden at the back. There was the marriage of
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert over the chimney-piece, and a
tortoiseshell cat with a collar on the oilskin cover of a square
table, who rose as though half resenting strange visitors; then,
after stretching, decided on some haven less liable to disturbance,
and went through the window to it without effort, emotion, or sound.
There was a clock under a glass cover on the chimney-piece whose
works you could see through, with a fascinating ratchet movement of
perfect grace and punctuality. Also a vertical orange-yellow glass
vase, twisted to a spiral, and full of spills. Also the leaning
tower of Pisa, done small in alabaster. He could see all these
things quite plainly, and but that his tongue seemed to have struck
work, could have described them. But he could not make himself out,
nor how and why he came to be there at all. Where ought

<!-- Page 25 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
he to have
been, he asked himself? And, to his horror, he could not make that
out either. Never mind. Patience was the word, clearly. Let him shut
his eyes as he sat there, in the little breakfast-room, with the
flies continually droning in the ceiling, and an especially large
bluebottle busy in the window, who might just as easily have gone
out and enjoyed the last hour of a long evening in a glorious
sunshine, but who mysteriously preferred to beat himself for ever
against a closed pane of glass, a self-constituted prisoner between
it and a gauze blind&mdash;let him shut his eyes, and try to think out
what it all meant, what it was all about.</p>

<p>All that he was perfectly certain of, at that moment, was that he
was awake, with a contused pain all over, and a very stiff left hand
and foot. And that, knowing he had been insensible, he was striving
hard to remember what something was that had happened just before he
became insensible. He had nearly got it, once or twice. Yes, now he
<i>had</i> got it, surely! No, he hadn't. It was gone again.</p>

<p>A mind that is struggling to remember some particular thing does not
deal with other possibilities of oblivion. We all know the painful
phenomenon of being perfectly aware what it is we are trying to
remember, feeling constantly close to it, but always failing to
grasp it. We know what it will sound like when we say it, what it
will mean, where it was on the page we read it on. Oh dear
yes!&mdash;quite plainly. The only thing we can't remember for the life
of us is&mdash;what it <i>was</i>!</p>

<p>And while we are making stupendous efforts to recapture some such
thing, does it ever occur to any of us to ask if we may not be
mistaken in our tacit assumption that we are quite certain to
remember everything else as soon as we try? That, in fact, it may be
our memory-faculty itself that is in fault and that we are only
failing to recall one thing because at the moment it is that one
sole thing, and no other, that we are trying our brains against.</p>

<p>It was so in the pause of a few minutes in which this man we write
of, left to himself and the ticking of the clock, and hearing,
through the activity of the bluebottle and the monotony of the
ceiling flies, the murmur of a distant conversation between his late
companions, who for the moment had left him alone, tried in

<!-- Page 26 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
vain to
recover his particular thread of memory, without any uneasiness
about the innumerable skeins that made up the tissue of his record
of a lifetime.</p>

<p>When the young doctor returned, he found him still seated where he
had left him, one hand over his eyes, the other on his knee. As he
sat&mdash;for the doctor watched him from the door for a moment&mdash;he moved
and replaced either hand at intervals, with implied distress in the
movements. They gave the impression of constant attempt constantly
baffled. The doctor, a shrewd-seeming young man with an attentive
pale eye, and very fair hair, seemed to understand.</p>

<p>"Let me recommend you to be quiet and rest. Be quite quiet. You will
be all right when you have slept on it. Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale&mdash;that's the
lady you saw just now; this is her house&mdash;will see that you are
properly taken care of."</p>

<p>Then the man tried to speak; it was with an effort.</p>

<p>"I wish to thank&mdash;I must thank&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind thanks yet. All in good time. Now, what do you think you
can take&mdash;to eat or drink?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing to eat or drink."</p>

<p>"Well, you know best. However, there's tea coming; perhaps you'll go
so far as a cup of tea? You would be the better for it."</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Rosalind junior, or Sally, slept in the back bedroom on the
first-floor&mdash;that is to say, if we ignore the basement floor and
call the one flush with the street-door step the ground-floor. We
believe we are right in doing so. Rosalind senior, the mother, slept
in the front one. It wasn't too late for tea, they had decided, and
thereupon they had gone upstairs to revise and correct.</p>

<p>After a certain amount of slopping and splashing in the back room,
uncorroborated by any in the front, Sally called out to her mother,
on the disjointed lines of talk in real life:</p>

<p>"I like this soap! Have you a safety-pin?" Whereto her mother
replied, speaking rather drowsily and perfunctorily:</p>

<p>"Yes, but you must come and get it."</p>

<p>"It's so nice and oily. It's not from Cattley's?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is."</p>

<p>"I thought it was. Where's the pin?" At this point she came into her
mother's room, covering her slightly <i>retrouss&eacute;</i> nose

<!-- Page 27 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
with her
fresh-washed hands, to enjoy the aroma of Cattley's soap.</p>

<p>"In the little pink saucer. Only don't mess my things about."</p>

<p>"Headache, mammy dear?" For her mother was lying back on the bed,
with her eyes closed. The speaker left her hands over her nostrils
as she spoke, to do full justice to the soap, pausing an instant in
her safety-pin raid for the answer:</p>

<p>"I've been feeling the heat. It's nothing. You go down, and I'll
come."</p>

<p>"Have some eau-de-Cologne?" But, alas! there was no eau-de-Cologne.</p>

<p>"Never mind. You go down, and I'll follow. I shall be all right
after a cup of tea." And Sally, after an intricate movement with a
safety-pin, an openwork lace cuff that has lost a button, and a
white wrist, goes down three accelerandos of stair-lengths, with
landing pauses, and ends with a dining-room door staccato. But she
isn't long gone, for in two minutes the door reopens, and she comes
upstairs as fast, nearly, as she went down. In her hand she carries,
visibly, Johann Maria Farina.</p>

<p>"Where on earth did you find that?" says her mother.</p>

<p>"The man had it. Wasn't it funny? He heard me say to Dr.&nbsp;Vereker
that I was so sorry I'd not been able to eau-de-Cologne your
forehead, and he began speaking and couldn't get his words. Then he
got this out of his pocket. I remember one of the men at the station
said something about his having a bottle, but I thought he meant a
pocket-flask. He looks the sort of man that would have a
pocket-flask and earrings."</p>

<p>Her mother doesn't seem to find this inexplicable, nor to need
comment. Rather the contrary. Sally dabs her brow with
eau-de-Cologne, beneficially, for she seems better, and says now go;
she won't be above a couple of minutes. Nor is she, in the sense in
which her statement has been accepted, for she comes downstairs
within seven by the clock with the dutiful ratchet movement.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>When she came within hearing of those in the room below, she heard a
male voice that was not Dr.&nbsp;Vereker's. Yes, the man (whom we still
cannot speak of by a name) was saying something&mdash;slowly,
perhaps&mdash;but fairly articulately and intelligibly.

<!-- Page 28 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
She went very
deliberately, and listened in the doorway. She looked very pale, and
very interested&mdash;a face of fixed attention, of absorption in
something she was irresolute about, rather than of doubt about what
she heard; an expression rather out of proportion to the concurrent
facts, as we know them.</p>

<p>"What is so strange"&mdash;this is what the man was saying, in his slow
way&mdash;"is that I could find words to tell you, if I could remember
what it is I have to tell. But when I try to bring it back, my head
fails. Tell me again, mademoiselle, about the railway-carriage."
Sally wondered why she was mademoiselle, but recognised a tone of
deference in his use of the word. She did as he asked her, slightly
interrupting her narrative to make sure of getting the tea made
right as she did so.</p>

<p>"I trod on your foot, you know. (One, two, three spoonfuls.) Surely
you must remember that? (Four, and a little one for the pot.)"</p>

<p>"I have completely forgotten it."</p>

<p>"Then I was sorry, and said I would have come off sooner if I had
known it was a foot. You <i>must</i> remember that?" The man half smiled
as he shook a slow-disclaiming head&mdash;one that would have remembered
so gladly, if it could. "Then," continues Sally, "I saw your
thumb-ring for rheumatism."</p>

<p>"My thumb-ring!" He presses his fingers over his closed eyes, as
though to give Memory a better chance by shutting off the visible
present, then withdraws them. "No, I remember no ring at all."</p>

<p>"How extraordinary!"</p>

<p>"I remember a violent concussion <i>somewhere</i>&mdash;I can't say where&mdash;and
then finding myself in a cab, trying to speak to a lady whose face
seemed familiar to me, but who she could be I had not the slightest
idea. Then I tried to get out of the cab, and found I could not
move&mdash;or hardly."</p>

<p>"Look at mamma again! Here she is, come." For Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale has
come into the room, looking white. "Yes, mother dear, I have. Quite
full up to the brim. Only it isn't ready to pour yet." This last
concerns the tea.</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale moves round behind the tea-maker, and comes
full-face in front of her guest. One might have fancied that the
hand that held the pocket-handkerchief that caused the smell

<!-- Page 29 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of
eau-de-Cologne that came in with her was tremulous. But then that
very eau-de-Cologne was eloquent about the recent effect of the
heat. Of course, she was a little upset. Nothing strikes either the
doctor or Mademoiselle Sally as abnormal or extraordinary. The
latter resumes:</p>

<p>"Surely, sir! Oh, you must, you <i>must</i> remember about the name
Nightingale?"</p>

<p>"This young gentleman said it just now. <i>Your</i> name, madame?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my name," says the lady addressed. But Sally
distinguishes:</p>

<p>"Yes, but I didn't mean that. I meant when I took the ring from you,
and was to pay for it. Sixpence. And you had no change for
half-a-crown. And then I gave you my mother's card to send it to us
here. One-and-elevenpence, because of the postage. Why, surely you
can remember that!" She cannot bring herself to believe him. Dr.
Vereker does, though, and tells him not to try recollecting; he will
only put himself back. "Take the tea and wait a bit," is the
doctor's advice. For Miss Sally is transmitting a cup of tea with
studied equilibrium. He receives it absently, leaving it on the
table.</p>

<p>"I do not know if you will know what I mean," he says, "but I have a
sort of feeling of&mdash;of being frightened; for I have been trying to
remember things, and I find I can remember almost nothing. Perhaps I
should say I cannot remember <i>at all</i>&mdash;can't do any recollecting, if
you understand." Every one can understand&mdash;at least, each says so.
Sally goes on, half <i>sotto voce</i>: "You can recollect your own name,
I suppose?" She speaks half-way between soliloquy and dialogue. The
doctor throws in counsel, aside, for precaution.</p>

<p>"You'll only make matters worse, like that. Better leave him quite
alone."</p>

<p>But the man's hearing doesn't seem to have suffered, for he catches
the remark about his name.</p>

<p>"I can't tell," he says. "I am not so sure. Of course, I can't have
forgotten my own name, because that's impossible. I will tell it you
in a minute.... Oh dear!..."</p>

<p>The young doctor seemed to disapprove highly of these efforts, and
to wish to change the conversation. "Let it alone now," said

<!-- Page 30 -->

he.
"Only for a little. Would you kindly allow me to see your arm
again?"</p>

<p>"Let him drink his tea first." This is from Miss Sally, the
tea-priestess. "Another cup?" But no; he won't take another cup,
thanks.</p>

<p>"Now let's have the coat off, and get another look at the arm; never
mind apologizing." But the patient had not contemplated apology. It
was the stiffness made him slow. However, he got his coat off, and
drew the blue shirt off his left arm. He had a fine hand and arm,
but the hand hung inanimate, and the fingers looked scorched. Dr.
Vereker began feeling the arm at intervals all the way up, and
asking each time questions about the degree of sensibility.</p>

<p>"I couldn't say whether it's normal or not up there." So the patient
testified. And Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale, who was watching the examination
intently, suggested trying the other arm in the same place for
comparison.</p>

<p>"You didn't see the other arm at the station, doctor?" she said.</p>

<p>"Didn't I?"</p>

<p>"I was asking."</p>

<p>"Well, no. Now I come to think of it, I don't think I did. We'll
have a look now, anyhow."</p>

<p>"<i>You're</i> a nice doctor!" This is from Miss Sally; a little
confidential fling at the profession. She is no respecter of
persons. Her mother would, no doubt, check her&mdash;a pert little
monkey!&mdash;only she is absorbed in the examination.</p>

<p>The doctor, as he ran back the right-arm sleeve, uttered an
exclamation. "Why, my dear sir," cried he, "here we have it! What
more can we want?"&mdash;and pointed at the arm. And Sally said, as
though relieved: "He's got his name written on him plain enough,
anyhow!" Her mother gave a sigh of relief, or something like it, and
said, "Yes." The patient himself seemed quite as much perplexed as
pleased at the discovery, saying only, in a subdued way: "It <i>must</i>
be my name." But he did not seem to accept at all readily the name
tattooed on his arm: "A. Fenwick, 1878."</p>

<p>"Whose name can it be if it is not yours?" said Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale.
She fixed her eyes on his face, as though to watch his effort

<!-- Page 31 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of
memory. "Try and think." But the doctor protested.</p>

<p>"Don't do anything of the sort," said he. "It's very bad for him,
Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale. He <i>mustn't</i> think. Just let him rest."</p>

<p>The patient, however, could not resign himself without a struggle to
this state of anonymous ambiguity. His bewilderment was painful to
witness. "If it were my name," he said, speaking slowly and not very
clearly, "surely it would bring back the first name. I try to recall
the word, and the effort is painful, and doesn't succeed." His
hostess seemed much interested, even to the extent of ignoring the
doctor's injunctions.</p>

<p>"Very curious! If you heard the name now, would you recollect it?"</p>

<p>"I <i>wish</i> you wouldn't try these experiments," says the doctor.
"They won't do him <i>any</i> good. <i>Rest's</i> the thing."</p>

<p>"I think I would rather try," says Fenwick, as we may now call him.
"I will be quiet if I can get this right."</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale begins repeating names that begin with A. "Alfred,
Augustus, Arthur, Andrew, Algernon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fenwick's face brightens. "That's it!" says he. "Algernon. I knew it
quite well all the time, of course. But I couldn't&mdash;couldn't....
However, I don't feel that I shall make myself understood."</p>

<p>"I can't make out," said Sally, "how you came to remember the bottle
of eau-de-Cologne."</p>

<p>"I did not remember it. I do not now. I mean, how it came to be in
the pocket. I can remember nothing else that was there&mdash;would have
been, that is. There is nothing else there now, except my cigar-case
and a pocket-book with nothing much in it. I can tell nothing about
my watch. A watch ought to be there."</p>

<p>"There, there!" says the doctor; "you will remember it all
presently. Do take my advice and be quiet, and sit still and don't
talk."</p>

<p>But half an hour or more after, although he had taken this advice,
Fenwick remembered nothing, or professed to have remembered nothing.
He seemed, however, much more collected, and except on the
memory-point nearly normal.</p>

<p>When the doctor, looking at his watch, referred to his obligation

<!-- Page 32 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
to keep another engagement, Fenwick rose, saying that he was now
perfectly well able to walk, and he would intrude no longer on his
hostesses' hospitality. This would have been perfectly reasonable,
but for one thing. It had come out that his pockets were empty, and
he was evidently quite without any definite plan as to what he
should do next, or where he should go. He was only anxious to
relieve his new friends of an encumbrance. He was evidently the sort
of person on whom the character sat ill; one who would always be
most at ease when shifting for himself; such a one as would reply to
any doubt thrown on his power of doing so, that he had been in many
a worse plight than this before. Yet you would hardly have classed
him on that account as an adventurer, because that term implies
unscrupulousness in the way one shifts for oneself. His face was a
perfectly honourable one. It was a face whose strength did not
interfere with its refinement, and there was a pleasant candour in
the smile that covered it as he finally made ready to depart with
the doctor. He should never, he said, know how to be grateful enough
to madame and her daughter for their kindness to him. But when
pressed on the point of where he intended to go, and how they should
hear what had become of him, he answered vaguely. He was undecided,
but, of course, he would write and tell them as they so kindly
wished to hear of him. Would mademoiselle give him the address
written down?</p>

<p>They found themselves&mdash;at least, the doctor and Sally
did&mdash;inferring, from his refreshed manner and his confidence about
departing, that his memory was coming back, or would come back. It
might have seemed needless inquisitiveness to press him with further
questions. They left the point alone. After all, they had no more
right to catechize him about himself than if he had been knocked
down by a cart outside the door, and brought into the house
unconscious&mdash;a thing which might quite well have happened.</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale seemed very anxious he should not go away quite
unprovided with money. She asked Dr.&nbsp;Vereker to pass him on a loan
from her before he parted with him. He could post it back when it
was quite convenient, so the doctor was to tell him. The doctor
asked, Wasn't a sovereign a large order? But she seemed to think
not. "Besides," said she, "it makes it certain

<!-- Page 33 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
we shall not lose
sight of him. I'm not sure we ought to let him go at all," added
she. She seemed very uneasy about it&mdash;almost exaggeratedly so, the
doctor thought. But he was reassuring and confident, and she allowed
his judgment to overrule hers. But he must bring him back without
scruple if he saw reason to do so. He promised, and the two departed
together, the gait and manner of Fenwick giving rise to no immediate
apprehension.</p>

<p>"How rum!" said Sally, when they had gone. "I never thought I should
live to see a man electrocuted."</p>

<p>"A man what?"</p>

<p>"Well, half-electrocuted, then. I say, mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, dear?" She is looking very tired, and speaks absently. Sally
makes the heat responsible again in her mind, and continues:</p>

<p>"I don't believe his name's Algernon at all! It's Arthur, or Andrew,
or something of that sort."</p>

<p>"You're very wise, poppet. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you stopped such a long time after Algernon. It was like
cheating at Spiritualism. You <i>must</i> say the alphabet quite
steady&mdash;A&mdash;B&mdash;C&mdash;D&mdash;&mdash;" Sally sketches out the proper attitude for
the impartial inquirer. "Or else you're an accomplice."</p>

<p>"You're a puss! No, <i>his</i> name's Algernon, right enough.... I mean,
I've no doubt it's Algernon. Why shouldn't it be?"</p>

<p>"No reason at all. Dr.&nbsp;Vereker's is Conrad, so, of course, there's
no reason why his shouldn't be Algernon." Satisfactory and
convincing! At least, the speaker thinks so, and is perfectly
satisfied. Her mother doesn't quarrel with the decision.</p>

<p>"Kitten!" she says suddenly. And then in reply to her daughter's,
"What's up, mammy dear?" she suggests that they shall walk out in
front&mdash;it is a quiet, retired sort of cul-de-sac road, ending in a
fence done over with tar, with nails along the top like the letter
<i>L</i> upside down&mdash;in the cool. "It's quite delicious now the sun's
gone down, and Martha can make supper another half-hour late."
Agreed.</p>

<p>The mother pauses as they reach the gate. "Who's that talking?" she
asks, and listens.</p>

<p>"Nobody. It's only the sparrows going to bed."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 34 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"No, no; not that! Shish! be quiet! I'm sure I heard Dr.&nbsp;Vereker's
voice&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How could you? He's home by now."</p>

<p>"Do be quiet, child!" She continues listening.</p>

<p>"Why not look round the corner and see if it isn't him?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was going to; only you and the sparrows make such a
chattering.... There, I knew it would be that! Why doesn't he bring
him back here, at once?" For at the end of the short road are Dr.
Vereker and Fenwick, the latter with his hand on the top of a post,
as though resting. They must have been there some minutes.</p>

<p>"Fancy their having got no further than the fire-alarm!" says Sally,
who takes account of her surroundings.</p>

<p>"Of course, I ought never to have let him go." Thus her mother, with
decision in her voice. "Come on, child!"</p>

<p>She seems greatly relieved at the matter having settled itself&mdash;so
Sally thinks, at least.</p>

<p>"We got as far as this," Dr.&nbsp;Vereker says&mdash;rather meaninglessly, if
you come to think of it. It is so very obvious.</p>

<p>"And now," says Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale, "how is he to be got back again?
That's the question!" She seems not to have the smallest doubt about
the question, but much about the answer. It is answered, however,
with the assistance of the previous police-constable, who reappears
like a ghost. And Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick is back again within the little white
villa, much embarrassed at the trouble he is giving, but unable to
indicate any other course. Clearly, it would never do to accept the
only one he can suggest&mdash;that he should be left to himself, leaning
on the fire-alarm, till the full use of his limbs should come back
to him.</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale, who is the person principally involved, seems
quite content with the arrangement. The doctor, in his own mind, is
rather puzzled at her ready acquiescence; but, then, the only
suggestion he could make would be that he should do precisely the
same good office himself to this victim of an electric current of a
good deal too many volts&mdash;too many for private consumption&mdash;or cab
him off to the police-station or the workhouse. For Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick
continues quite unable to give any account of his past or his
belongings, and can only look forward to recollecting himself, as it
were, to-morrow morning.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="subhead">HOW THE STRANGER STOPPED ON AT KRAKATOA VILLA. OF THE FREAKS OF AN
EXTINGUISHED MEMORY. OF HOW THE STRANGER GOT A GOOD APPOINTMENT, BUT
NONE COULD SAY WHO HE WAS, NOR&nbsp;WHENCE</p>

<p>We must suppose that the personal impression produced by the man so
strangely thrown on the hands of Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale and her daughter
was a pleasant one. For had the reverse been the case, the resources
of civilisation for disposing of him elsewhere had not been
exhausted when the decision was come to that he should remain where
he was; till next morning, at any rate. The lady of the house&mdash;of
course the principal factor in the solution of the
problem&mdash;appeared, as we have seen, to have made up her mind on the
subject. And probably her daughter had been enough influenced by the
stranger's manner and appearance, even in the short period of the
interview we have just described, to get rid of a feeling she had of
self-reproach for her own rashness. We don't understand girls, but
we ask this question of those who do: Is it possible that Miss Sally
was impressed by the splendid arm with the name tattooed on it&mdash;an
arm in which every muscle told as in a Greek statue, without
infringing on its roundness&mdash;the arm of Theseus or Ilissus? Or was
it the tone of his voice&mdash;a musical one enough? Or merely his
generally handsome face and courteous manner?</p>

<p>He remained that night at the house, but next day still remembered
nothing. He wished to go on his way&mdash;destination not known; but
<i>somewhere</i>&mdash;and would have done so had it not been for Mrs.
Nightingale, whose opposition to his going was, thought Dr.&nbsp;Vereker,
almost more decisive than the case called for. So he remained on,
that day and the next, slowly regaining the use of his right hand.
But his memory continued a blank; and though he was not unable to
converse about passing events, he could not fix his attention, or
only with a great effort. What was very annoying to Sally was that
he was absolutely unable to account

<!-- Page 36 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
for his remark about her name
and her mother's in the railway-carriage. He could not even remember
making this. He could recall no reason why he should have made it,
from any of the few things that came back to his mind now&mdash;hazily,
like ghosts. Was he speaking the truth? Why not? Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale
asked. Why not forget that as readily as anything else?</p>

<p>His distress at this inability to remember, to account for himself,
to himself or any one else, was almost painful to witness. The only
consolatory circumstance was that his use and knowledge of words
remained intact; it was his memory of actual incidents and people in
the past that was in fault. Definite effort to follow slight clues
remaining in his mind ended in failure, or only served to show that
their origin was traceable to literary fiction. But his
language-faculty seemed perfectly in order. It came out that he
spoke French fluently, and a little Spanish, but he was just as
ready with German. It seemed as if he had been recently among French
people, if one could judge from such things as his calling his
hostess "Madame" when he recovered. These facts came to light in the
course of next day, the second of his stay in the house. The
favourable impression he had produced on Miss Sally did not
diminish, and it seemed much easier and more natural to acquiesce in
his remaining than to cast about for a new whereabouts to transfer
him to. So his departure was deferred&mdash;for a day, at least, or
perhaps until the room he occupied should be wanted for other
purposes. The postponements on the days that followed were a natural
sequence so long as there remained any doubt of his ability to shift
for himself.</p>

<p>But in about a month's time the effects of the nervous shock had
nearly disappeared, and he had almost recovered the use of his
hand&mdash;could, in fact, write easily. Besides, as long as he remained,
it would be impossible for an old friend of Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale's, who
frequently stayed the night, when he came on an evening visit, to
follow a custom which was in the winter almost invariable. In the
summer it was less important; and as soon as this friend, an old
military gentleman spoken of as "the Major," could be got to
understand exactly what had taken place, he readily gave up his
quarters at Krakatoa Villa, and returned to his own, at the top of a
house in Ball Street, Mayfair.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 37 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, the inevitable time came for looking Fenwick's future
in the face. It was difficult, as he was unable to contribute a
solution of the question, except by his readiness to go out and find
work for himself, promising not to come back till he found it.</p>

<p>"You'll see I shall come back to dinner," said he. "I shan't make
you late."</p>

<p>Sally asked him what sort of work he should look for.</p>

<p>"I have a sort of inner conviction," he replied, "that I could do
almost anything I turned my hand to. Probably it is only a diseased
confidence bred of what you might call my artificial inexperience.
Every sharp young man's <i>bona fide</i> inexperience lands him in that
delusion."</p>

<p>"But you must have <i>some</i> kind of preference for <i>something</i>,
however much you forget."</p>

<p>"If I were to choose, I think I should like horse-training.... Oh
no, of course I can't recall the training of any specific horse. But
I know I know all about it, for all that. I can feel the knowledge
of it itching in my finger-ends. Yes&mdash;I could train horses.
Fruit-farming would require capital."</p>

<p>"Who said anything about fruit-farming?"</p>

<p>Fenwick laughed aloud. It was a great big laugh, that made Rosalind,
who was giving directions in the kitchen, just across the passage,
call out to know what they were laughing at.</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if I know," said he, "<i>why</i> I said fruit-farming&mdash;I
must have had something to do with it. It's all very odd."</p>

<p>"But the horses&mdash;the horses," said Sally, who did not want him to
wander from the point. "How should you go about it? Should you walk
into Tattersall's without a character, and ask for a place?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it! I should saunter into Tat's' like a swell, and ask
them if they couldn't find me a raw colt to try my hand on for a
wager. Say I had laid a hundred I would quiet down the most vicious
quadruped they could find in an hour."</p>

<p>"But that would be fibs."</p>

<p>"Oh no! I could do it. But I don't know why I know...."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that. I meant you wouldn't have laid the wager."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 38 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Yes, I should. I lay it you now! Come, Miss Sally!&mdash;a hundred
pounds to a brass farthing I knock all the vice out of the worst
beast they can find in an hour. I shouldn't say the wager had been
accepted, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, I shan't accept it. You haven't got a hundred pounds
to pay with. To be sure, I haven't got a brass farthing that I know
of. It's as broad as it is long."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's that," he replied musingly&mdash;"as broad as it is long. I
<i>haven't</i> got a hundred pounds, that I know of." He repeated this
twice, becoming very absent and thoughtful.</p>

<p>Sally felt apologetic for reminding him of his position, and
immediately said so. She was evidently a girl quite incapable of any
reserves or concealments. But she had mistaken his meaning.</p>

<p>"No, no, dear Miss Sally," said he. "Not that&mdash;not that at all! I
spoke like that because it all seemed so strange to me. Do you
know?&mdash;of all the things I can't recollect, the one I can't
recollect <i>most</i>&mdash;can you understand?&mdash;is ever being in want of
money. I <i>must</i> have had plenty. I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"I dare say you had. You'll recollect it all presently, and what a
lark that will be!" Sally's ingenious optimism made matters very
pleasant. She did not like to press the conversation on these lines,
lest Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick should refer to a loan she knew her mother had made
him; indeed, had it not been for this the poor man would have been
hard put to it for clothes and other necessaries. All such little
matters, which hardly concern the story, had been landed on a
comfortable footing at the date of this conversation.</p>

<p>But Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick did not lend himself to the agreeable anticipation
of Sally's "lark." There was a pained distraction on his handsome
face as he gave his head a great shake, tossing about the mass of
brown hair, which was still something of a lion's mane, in spite of
the recent ministrations of a hairdresser. He walked to the
window-bay that looked out on the little garden, shaking and rubbing
his head, and then came back to where he had been sitting&mdash;always as
one wrestling with some painful half-memory he could not trace. Then
he spoke again.</p>

<p>"Whether the sort of flash that comes in my mind of writing my name
in a cheque-book is really a recollection of doing so, or merely

<!-- Page 39 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the knowledge that I <i>must</i> have done so, I cannot tell. But it is
disagreeable&mdash;thoroughly disagreeable&mdash;and <i>strange</i> to the last
degree. I cannot tell you how&mdash;how torturing it is, always to be
compelled to stop on the threshold of an uncompleted recollection."</p>

<p>"I have the idea, though, quite!" said Sally. "But of course one
never remembers signing one's name, any particular time. One does it
mechanically. So I don't wonder."</p>

<p>"Yes! But the nasty part of the flash is that I always know that it
is not <i>my</i> name. Last time it came&mdash;just now this minute&mdash;it was a
name like Harrington or Carrington. Oh dear!" He shook and rubbed
his head again, with the old action.</p>

<p>"Perhaps your name isn't Fenwick, but Harrington or Carrington?"</p>

<p>"No! That cock won't fight. In a flash, I know it's not my <i>own</i>
name as I write it."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I see!" Sally is triumphant. "You signed for a firm you
belonged to, of course. People <i>do</i> sign for firms, don't they?"
added she, with misgivings about her own business capacity. But Mr.
Fenwick did not accept this solution, and continued silent and
depressed.</p>

<p>The foregoing is one of many similar conversations between Fenwick
and Sally, or her mother, or all three, during the term of his stay
at Krakatoa Villa. They were less encouraged by the older lady, who
counselled Fenwick to accept his oblivion passively, and await the
natural return of his mental powers. They would all come in time,
she said; and young Dr.&nbsp;Vereker, though his studious and responsible
face grew still more studious and responsible as time went on, and
the mind of this case continued a blank, still encouraged passivity,
and spoke confidently&mdash;whatever he thought&mdash;of an early and complete
recovery.</p>

<p>When, in Fenwick's absence, Sally reported to Dr.&nbsp;Vereker and her
mother the scheme for applying to "Tat's" for a wild horse to break
in, the latter opposed and denounced it so strongly, on the ground
of the danger of the experiment, that both Sally and the doctor
promised to support her if Fenwick should broach the idea again. But
when he did so, it was so clear that the disfavour Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale
showed for such a risky business would be sufficient to deter him
from trying it that neither thought it necessary

<!-- Page 40 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
to say a word in
her support; and the conversation went off into a discussion of how
it came about that Fenwick should remember Tattersall's. But, said
he, he did not remember Tattersall's even now. And yet hearing the
name, he had automatically called it "Tat's." Many other instances
showed that his power of imagery, in relation to the past, was
paralysed, while his language-faculty remained intact, just as many
fluent speakers and writers spell badly. Only it was an extreme
case.</p>

<p>A fortunate occurrence that happened at this time gave its quietus
to the unpopular horse-breaking speculation. It happened that, as
Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale was shopping at a big "universal providing" stores
not far away, one of the clerks had some difficulty in interpreting
a French phrase in a letter just received from abroad. No one near
him looked more likely to help than Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale, but she could
do nothing when applied to; although, she said, she had been taught
French in her youth. But she felt certain Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick could be of
use&mdash;at her house. French idiom was evidently unfamiliar in the
neighbourhood, for the young gentleman from the office jumped at the
opportunity. He went away with Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale's card, inscribed
with a message, and came back before she had done shopping (not that
that means such a very short time), not only with an interpretation,
but with an exhaustive draft of an answer in French, which she saw
to be both skilful and scholarly. It was so much so that a fortnight
later an inquiry came to know if Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's services would be
available for a firm in the City, which had applied to be
universally provided with a man having exactly his attainments and
no others. In less than a month he was installed in a responsible
position as their foreign correspondent and in receipt of a very
respectable salary. The rapidity of phrasing in this movement was
abnormal&mdash;<i>prestissimo</i>, in fact, if we indulge our musical
vocabulary. But the instrumentation would have seemed less
surprising to Sally had she known the lengths her mother had gone in
the proffer of a substantial guarantee for Fenwick's personal
honesty. This seeming rashness did not transpire at the time; had it
done so, it might have appeared unintelligible&mdash;to Sally, at any
rate. She would not have been surprised at herself for backing the
interests

<!-- Page 41 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of a man nearly electrocuted over her half-crown, but why
should her mother endorse her <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> so enthusiastically?</p>

<p>It is perhaps hardly necessary for us to dwell on the unsuccessful
attempts that were made to recover touch with other actors on the
stage of Fenwick's vanished past. Advertisement&mdash;variously
worded&mdash;in the second column of the "Times," three times a week for
a month, produced no effect. Miss Sally frequently referred with
satisfaction to the case of John Williams, reported among the
Psychical Researches of the past years, in which a man who vanished
in England was found years after carrying on a goods-store in
Chicago under another name, with a new wife and family, having
utterly forgotten the first half of his life and all his belongings.
Her mother seemed only languidly interested in this illustration,
and left the active discussion of the subject chiefly to Sally, who
speculated endlessly on the whole of the story; without, however,
throwing any fresh light on it&mdash;unless indeed, the Chicago man could
be considered one. And the question naturally arose, as long as his
case continued to hold out hopes of a sudden return of memory, and
until we were certain his condition was chronic, why go to expense
and court publicity? By the time he was safely installed in his
situation at the wine-merchant's, the idea of a police-inquiry,
application to the magistrates, and so forth, had become distasteful
to all concerned, and to none more so than Fenwick himself.</p>

<p>When Dr.&nbsp;Vereker, acting on his own account, and unknown to Mrs.
Nightingale and Fenwick, made confidential reference to Scotland
Yard, that Yard smiled cynically over the Chicago storekeeper, and
expressed the opinion that probably Fenwick's game was a similar
game, and that things of this sort were usually some game. The
doctor observed that he knew without being told that nine such cases
out of ten had human rascality at the bottom of them, but that he
had consulted that Yard in the belief that this might be a tenth
case. The Yard said very proper, and it would do its best, and no
doubt did, but nothing was elucidated.</p>

<p>It is just possible that had Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick communicated <i>every</i> clue
he found, down to the smallest trifle, Dr.&nbsp;Vereker might have been
able to get at something through the Criminal Investigation

<!-- Page 42 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Department. But it wasn't fair to Sherlock Holmes to keep anything
back. Fenwick, knowing nothing of Vereker's inquiry, did so; for he
had decided to say nothing about a certain pawn-ticket that was in
the pocket of an otherwise empty purse or pocket-book, evidently
just bought. He would, however, investigate it himself, and did so.</p>

<p>It was quite three weeks, though, before he felt safe to go about
alone to any place distant from the house, more especially when he
did not know what the expedition would lead to. When at last he got
to the pawnbroker's, he found that that gentleman at the counter did
not recognise him, or said he did not. Fenwick, of course, could not
ask the question: "Did I pawn this watch?" It would have seemed
lunacy. But he framed a question that answered as well, to his
thinking.</p>

<p>"Would you very kindly tell me," he asked, dropping his voice,
"whether the person that pawned this watch was at all like me&mdash;like
a brother of mine, for instance?" Perhaps he was not a good hand at
pretences, and the pawnbroker outclassed him easily.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied he, without looking to see; "that I most
certainly can <i>not</i> tell you." Fenwick was not convinced that this
was true, but had to admit to himself that it might be. This man's
life was one long record of an infinity of short loans, and its
problem was the advancing of the smallest conceivable sums on the
largest obtainable security. Why <i>should</i> he recollect one drop in
the ocean of needy applicants? The only answer Fenwick could give to
this was based on his belief that he looked quite unlike the other
customers. More knowledge would have shown him that there was not
one of those customers, scarcely, but had a like belief. It is the
common form of human thought among those who seek to have pawns
broked. They are a class made up entirely of exceptions.</p>

<p>Fenwick came away from the shop with the watch that <i>must have been</i>
his. That was how he thought of it. As soon as he wore it again, it
became <i>his</i> watch, naturally. But he could remember nothing about
it. And its recovery from the pawnbroker's he could not remember
leaving it at became an absurd dream. Perhaps in Sherlock Holmes's
hands it would have provided a valuable clue. Fenwick said nothing
further about it; put

<!-- Page 43 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
it in a drawer until all inquiries about him
had died into the past.</p>

<p>Another little thing that might have helped was the cabman's number
written on his wristband. But here Fate threw investigation off her
guard. The ciphers were, as it chanced, 3,600; and an unfortunate
shrewdness of Scotland Yard, when Dr.&nbsp;Vereker communicated this
clue, spotted the date in it&mdash;the third day of the sixth month of
1900. So no one dreamed of the cabby, who could at least have shown
where the hat was lost that might have had a name or address inside
it, and where he left its owner in the end. And there was absolutely
no clue to anything elsewhere among his clothes. The Panama hat
might have been bought anywhere; the suit of blue serge was
ticketless inside the collar, and the shirt unmarked&mdash;probably
bought for the voyage only. Fenwick had succeeded in forgetting
himself just at a moment when he was absolutely without a reminder.
And it seemed there was nothing for it but to wait for the revival
of memory.</p>

<p>This, then, is how it came about that, within three months of his
extraordinary accident, Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick was comfortably settled in an
apartment within a few minutes' walk of Krakatoa Villa; and all the
incidents of his original appearance were getting merged in the
insoluble, and would soon, no doubt, under the influence of a steady
ever-present new routine of life, be completely absorbed in the
actual past.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="subhead">THE CHRISTMAS AFTER. OF THE CHURCH OF ST. SATISFAX, AND A YOUNG
IDIOT WHO CAME&nbsp;THERE</p>

<p>When one is called away in the middle of a street-fight, and misses
seeing the end of it, how embittered one's existence is, and
continues for some time after! Think what our friend the cabman
would have felt had he missed the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>! And when one finds
oneself again on its site&mdash;if that is the correct expression&mdash;how
one wishes one was not ashamed to inquire about its result from the
permanent officials on the spot&mdash;the waterman attached to the
cab-rank, the crossing-sweeper at the corner, the neolithographic
artist who didn't really draw that half-mackerel himself, but is
there all day long, for all that; or even the apothecary's shop over
the way, on the chance that the casualties went or were taken there
for treatment after the battle. One never does ask, because one is
so proud; but if one did ask, one would probably find that oblivion
had drawn a veil over the event, and that none of one's catechumens
had heard speak of any such an occurrence, and that it must have
been another street. Because, if it had 'a been there, they would
have seen to a certainty. And the monotonous traffic rolls on, on,
on; and the two counter-streams of creatures, each with a story,
divide and subdivide over the spot where the underneath man's head
sounded on the kerbstone, which took no notice at the time, and now
seems to know less than ever about it.</p>

<p>Are we, in thus moralising, merely taking the mean advantage the
author is apt to imagine he has established over his reader when he
ends off a chapter with a snap, and hopes the said reader will not
dare to skip? No, we are not. We really mean something, and shall
get to it in time. Let us only be clear what it is ourselves.</p>

<p>It refers, at any rate, to the way in which the contents of Chapters
I. and II. had become records of the past six months later,

<!-- Page 45 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
when
the snow was on the ground four inches thick on Christmas
morning&mdash;two inches, at least, having been last night's
contribution&mdash;and made it all sweet and smooth all over so that
there need be no unpleasantness. As Sally looked out of her mother's
bedroom window towards the front through the Venetian blind, she saw
the footprints of cats alone on the snow in the road, and of the
milk alone along the pavement. For the milk had preferred to come by
hand, rather than plough its tricycle through the unknown depths and
drifts of Glenmoira Road, W., to which it had found its way over
tracks already palliated by the courage of the early 'bus&mdash;not
plying for hire at that hour, but only seeking its equivalent of the
<i>carceres</i> of the Roman Coliseum, to inaugurate the carriage of
twelve inside and fourteen out to many kinds of Divine Service early
in the day, and one kind only of dinner-service late&mdash;the one folk
eat too much pudding and mince-pie at, and have to take a dose
after. During this early introductory movement of the 'bus its
conductor sits inside like a lord, and classifies documents. But he
has nothing to do with our story. Let us thank him for facilitating
the milk, and dismiss him.</p>

<p>"My gracious goodness me!" said Sally, when she saw the snow. She
did not say it quite from the bottom of her heart, and as her own
form of expression; but in inverted commas, as it were, the primary
responsibility being cook's or Jane's. "You mustn't think of getting
up, mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! I shall get up the minute the hot water comes."</p>

<p>"You won't do any good by getting up. You had much better lie in
bed. <i>I</i> shouldn't get up, if I was you," etc., etc.</p>

<p>"Oh, stuff! My rheumatism's better. Do you know, I really think the
ring <i>has</i> done it good. Dr.&nbsp;Vereker may laugh as much as he
likes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, the proof of the pudding's in the eating. But wait till you
see how thick the snow is. <i>Come&mdash;in!</i>" This is very staccato. Jane
was knocking at the door with cans of really hot water this time. "I
said come in before. Merry Christmas and happy New Year, Jane!...
Oh, I say! What a dear little robin! He's such a little duck, I hope
that cat won't get him!" And Sally, who is huddled up in a thick
dressing-gown and

<!-- Page 46 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
is shivering, is so excited that she goes on
looking through the blind, and the peep-hole she has had to make to
see clear through the frosted pane, in spite of the deadly cold on
the finger-tip she rubbed it with. Her mother felt interested, too,
in the fate of the robin, but not to the extent of impairing her
last two minutes in bed by admitting the slightest breath of cold
air inside a well-considered fortress. She was really going to get
up, though, that was flat! The fire would blaze directly, although
at this moment it was blowing wood-smoke down Jane's throat, and
making her choke.</p>

<p>Directly was five or six minutes, but the fire did blaze up royally
in the end. You see, it wasn't a slow-combustion-grate, and it
burned too much fuel, and flared away the coal, and did all sorts of
comfortable, uneconomical things. So did Jane, who had put in a
whole bundle of wood.</p>

<p>But now that the wood was past praying for, and Jane had departed,
after thawing the hearts of two sponges, it was just as well to take
advantage of the blaze while it lasted. And Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale and her
daughter, in the thickest available dressing-gowns, and pretending
they were not taking baths only because the bath-room was thrown out
of gear by the frost, took advantage of the said blaze to their
heart's content and harked back&mdash;a good way back&mdash;on the
conversation.</p>

<p>"You never said 'Come in,' chick."</p>

<p>"I <i>did</i>, mother! Well, if I didn't, at any rate, I always tell her
not to knock. She is the stupidest girl. She <i>will</i> knock!" Her
mother doesn't press the point. There is no bad blood anywhere. Did
not Sally wish the handmaiden a merry Christmas?</p>

<p>"The cat didn't get the robin, Sally?"</p>

<p>"Not he! The robin was too sharp by half. Such a little darling! But
I was sorry for the cat."</p>

<p>"Poor pussy! Not our pussy, was it?"</p>

<p>"Oh no; it was that piebald Tom that lives in at the empty house
next door."</p>

<p>"I know. Horrible beast!"</p>

<p>"Well, but just think of being out in the cold in this weather, with
nothing to eat! Oo&mdash;oo&mdash;oogh!" Sally illustrates, with an
intentional shudder. "I wonder who that is!"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 47 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"I didn't hear any one."</p>

<p>"You'll see, he'll ring directly. I know who it is; it's Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick
come to say he can't come to-night. I heard the click of his skates.
They've a sort of twinkly click, skates have, when they're swung by
a strap. He'll go out and skate all day. He'll go to Wimbledon."</p>

<p>The girl's hearing was quite correct. A ring came at the
bell&mdash;Krakatoa had no knocker&mdash;and a short colloquy followed between
Jane and the ringer. Then he departed, with his twinkly click and
noiseless footstep on the snow, slamming the front gate. Jane was
able to include a card he had left in a recrudescence or
reinforcement of hot water. Sally takes the card and looks at it,
and her mother says, "Well, Sally?" with a slight remonstrance
against the unfairness of keeping back information after you have
satisfied your own curiosity&mdash;a thing people are odious about, as we
all know.</p>

<p>"<i>He's</i> coming all right," says Sally, looking at both sides of the
card, and passing it on when she has quite done with it. Sally, we
may mention, as it occurs to us at this moment,&mdash;though <i>why</i> we
have no idea,&mdash;means to have a double chin when she is five years
older than her mother is now. At present it&mdash;the chin&mdash;is merely so
much youthful roundness and softness, very white underneath. Her
mother is quite of a different type. Her daughter's father must have
had black hair, for Sally can make huge shining coils, or close
plaits, very wide, out of her inheritance. Or it will assume the
form of a bush, if indulged, till Sally is almost hidden under it,
as the Bosjesman under his version of Birnam Wood, that he shoots
his assegai from. But the mother's is brown, with a tinge of
chestnut; going well with her eyes, which have a claret tone, or
what is so called; but we believe people really mean pale old port
when they say so. She has had&mdash;still has, we might say&mdash;a remarkably
fine figure, and we don't feel the same faith in Miss Sally's. That
young lassie will get described as plump some day, if she doesn't
take care.</p>

<p>But really it is a breach of confidence to get behind the scenes and
describe two ladies in this way, when they are so very much in
<i>d&eacute;shabille</i>&mdash;have not even washed! We will look at them again when
they have got their things on. However, they may go

<!-- Page 48 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
on talking now.
The blaze has lost its splendour, and dressing cannot be
indefinitely delayed. But they can and do talk from room to room,
confident that cook and Jane are in the basement out of hearing.</p>

<p>"We shall do nicely, kitten! Six at table. I'm glad Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick can
come. Aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Rather! Fancy having Dr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker and the dear old fossil
and nobody to help out!"</p>

<p>"My dear! You say 'Dr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker' as if he was a married
man!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;him and his mammy, then! He's good&mdash;but he's professional. Oh
dear&mdash;his professional manner! You have to be forming square to
receive cavalry every five minutes to prevent his writing you a
prescription."</p>

<p>"Ungrateful little monkey! You know the last he wrote you did you no
end of good."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I didn't ask him for it. He wrote it by force. I hate
being hectored over and bullied. I say, mother!"</p>

<p>"What, kitten?"</p>

<p>"I hope, as Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's coming, you'll wear your wedding-ring."</p>

<p>"Wear <i>what</i>?"</p>

<p>"Wear your wedding-ring. <i>His</i> ring, you know! You know what I
mean&mdash;the rheumatic one."</p>

<p>"Of course I know perfectly well what you mean," says her mother,
with a shade of impatience in her voice. "But why?"</p>

<p>"Why? Because it gives him pleasure always to see it on your
finger&mdash;he fancies it's doing good to the neuritis."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is."</p>

<p>"Very well, then; why not wear it?"</p>

<p>"Because it's so big, and comes off in the soup, and is a nuisance.
And, then, he didn't give it to me, either. He was to have had a
shilling for it."</p>

<p>"But he never <i>did</i> have it. And it wasn't a shilling. It was
sixpence. And he says it's the only little return he's ever been
able to make for what he calls our kindness."</p>

<p>"I couldn't shovel him out into the street."</p>

<p>"Put his wedding-ring on, mammy, to oblige me!"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 49 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Very well, chick&mdash;I don't mind." And so that point is settled. But
something makes the daughter repeat, as she comes into her mother's
room dry-towelling herself, "You're sure you don't mind, mammy?" to
which the reply is, "No, no! <i>Why</i> should I mind? It's all quite
right," with a forced decision, equivalent to wavering, about it.
Sally looks at her a moment in a pause of dry-towelling, and goes
back to her room not quite convinced. Persons of the same blood,
living constantly together, are sometimes quite embarrassed by their
own brain-waves, and very often misled.</p>

<p>Exigencies of teeth and hair cut the talk short about Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick.
But he gets renewed at breakfast, and, in fact, goes on more or less
until brought up short by the early service at St.&nbsp;Satisfax, when he
is extinguished by a preliminary hymn. But not before his whole
story, so far as is known, has been passed in review. So that an
attentive listener might have gathered from their disjointed chat
most of the particulars of his strange appearance on the scene, and
of the incidents of the next few weeks, and their result in the
foundation of what seemed likely to be a permanent friendship
between himself and Krakatoa Villa, and what certainly was (all
things considered) that most lucrative and lucky post in a good
wine-merchant's house in the City. For Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick had nothing to
recommend him but his address and capacity, brought into notice by
an accidental concurrence of circumstances.</p>

<p>It had been difficult to talk much about him to himself without
seeming to wish to probe into his past life; and as Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale
impressed on Sally for the twentieth time, just as they arrived at
St.&nbsp;Satisfax, they really knew nothing of it. How could they even
know that this oblivion was altogether genuine? It might easily have
been so at first, but who could say how much of his past had come
back to him during the last six months? An unwelcome past, perhaps,
and one he was glad to help Oblivion in extinguishing.</p>

<p>As this was on the semi-circular path in front of the Saint's
shrine, between two ramparts of swept-up snow, and on a corrective
of cinder-grit, Sally ascribed this speculation to a disposition on
her mother's part to preach, she having come, as it were, within the
scope and atmosphere of a pending decalogue. Also, she

<!-- Page 50 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
thought the
ostentatious way in which Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick had gone away to skate had
something to do with it.</p>

<p>But she was at all times conscious of a certain access of severity
in her mother as she approached altars&mdash;rather beyond the common
attitude of mind one ascribes to the bearer of a prayer-book when
one doesn't mean to go to church oneself. (We are indebted for this
piece of information to an intermittent church-goer; it is on a
subject on which our own impressions have little value.) In the
present case Sally <i>was</i> going to church, so she had to account to
herself for a <i>nuance</i> in her mother's manner&mdash;after dwelling on the
needlessness and inadvisability of pressing Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick as to his
recollections&mdash;by ascribing it to the consciousness of some
secularism elsewhere; and he was the nearest case of ungodliness to
hand.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he believes anything at all!" said Sally, assuming
the consecutiveness of her remark.</p>

<p>"I don't see why he shouldn't.... Why should he disbelieve more
than...? All I mean is, I don't know." The speaker ended abruptly;
but then that may have been because they were at the church door.
Possibly as a protest against having carried chat almost into the
precinct, Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale's preliminary burial of her face in her
hands lasted a long time&mdash;in fact, Sally almost thought she had gone
to sleep, and told her so afterwards. "Perhaps, though," she added,
"it was me came up from under the bedclothes too soon." Then she
thought her levity displeased her mother, and kissed her. But it
wasn't that. She was thoughtful over something else.</p>

<p>This time, in the church, it may be Sally noticed her mother's
abstraction (or was it, perhaps, devotional tension?) less than she
had done when her attention had been caught once or twice lately by
a similar strained look. For Miss Sally had her eyes on a little
gratifying incident of her own&mdash;a trifle that would already have
appeared as an incident in her diary, had she kept one, somewhat
thus:&mdash;"Saw that young idiot from Cattley's Stores again in church
to-day, in a new scarlet necktie. I wonder whether it's me, or Miss
Peplow that gollops, or the large Miss Baker." Which would have
shown that she was not always a nun breathless with adoration during
religious exercises. The fact is, Sally would have made a very poor
St.&nbsp;Teresa indeed.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 51 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
</div>

<p>The young idiot was the same young man who had brought the difficult
French idiom to Krakatoa, while Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick was still without an
anchorage of his own. Martha the cook, who admitted him, not feeling
equal to the negotiation, had merely said&mdash;would he mind steppin' in
the parlour, and she would send Miss Sally up? and had departed
bearing Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale's credential-card in a hand as free from
grease as an apron so deeply committed could make it, and brought
Miss Nightingale in from the garden, where she was
gardening&mdash;possibly effectually, but what do we know? When you are
gardening on a summer afternoon, you may look very fetching, if you
are nineteen, and the right sex for the adjective. Miss Sally did,
being both, and for our own part we think it was inconsiderate and
thoughtless of cook. Sally was sprung upon that young man like a
torpedo on a ship with no guards out, saying with fascinating
geniality through a smile (as one interests oneself in a civility
that means nothing) that Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick had just gone out, and she
didn't know when he would be back. But why not ask Mrs.&nbsp;Prince at
the school, opposite St.&nbsp;Satisfax, where we went to church; she was
French, and would be sure to know what it meant. <i>She</i> wouldn't
mind! "Say I sent you." And the youth, whom the torpedo had struck
amidships, was just departing, conscious of reluctance, when Mr.
Fenwick appeared, having come back for his umbrella.</p>

<p>Sally played quite fair. She didn't hang about as she might have
done, to rub her pearly teeth and merry eyebrows into her victim.
She went back and gardened honourably, while Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick solved the
riddle and supplied the letter. But for all that, the young man
appeared next Sunday at St.&nbsp;Satisfax's, with an extremely new
prayer-book that looked as if his religious convictions were recent,
and never took his eyes off Sally all through the service&mdash;that is,
if he did as she supposed, and peeped all the while that his head
ought to have been, as she metaphorically expressed it, "under the
clothes."</p>

<p>Now, this was naturally a little unaccountable to Sally, after such
a very short interview; and on the part, too, of a young gentleman
who passed all the working hours of the day among working houris, as
it were soaked and saturated in their fascinations, and not at
liberty to squeeze their hands or ask them for one

<!-- Page 52 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
little lock of
hair all through shop-time. Sally did not realise the force of
sameness, nor the amount of contempt familiarity will breed. Perhaps
the houris got tired and snappish, poor things! and used up their
artificial smiles on the customers. Perhaps it had leaked out that
the trying-on hands contributed only length, personally, to the
loveliness of the trying-on figures. All sorts of things might have
happened to influence this young man towards St.&nbsp;Satisfax; and how
did Sally know how often he had seen the other young lady
communicants she had speculated about? Her mind had certainly thrown
in the large Miss Baker with something of derision. But that Sylvia
Peplow was just the sort of girl men run after, like a big pale
gloire-de-Dijon rose all on one side, with pale golden wavy hair,
and great big goggly blue eyes, looking as if she couldn't help it!
Now that we have given you details, from Sally's inner
consciousness, of Miss Peplow's appearance, we hope you will
perceive why she said she "golloped." We don't, exactly.</p>

<p>However, on this Christmas morning it was made clear whom this young
donkey was hankering after&mdash;this is Sally's way of putting it&mdash;as
Miss Peplow failed to get her usual place through being late, and
had to sit in a side-aisle, instead of the opposite of her to the
idiot&mdash;we are again borrowing from Sally&mdash;and now the Idiot would
have to glare round over his shoulder at her or go without! It was
soon evident that he was quite content to go without, and that Sally
herself had been his lode-star. The certainty of this was what
prevented her taking so much notice of her mother as she might
otherwise have done.</p>

<p>Had she done so closely, she would hardly have put down her
preoccupation, or tension, or whatever it was, to displeasure at Mr.
Fenwick's going to skate on Christmas morning instead of going to
church. What concern was it of theirs what Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick did?</p>

<p class="subhead">OF BOXING DAY MORNING AT KRAKATOA VILLA, AND WHAT OBSERVANT

<p>The "dear old fossil" referred to by Miss Sally was one of those
occurrences&mdash;auxiliaries or encumbrances, as may be&mdash;whom one is
liable to meet with in almost any family, who are so forcibly taken
for granted by all its members that the infection of their
acceptance catches on, and no new-comer ever asks that they should
be explained. If they were relatives, they would be easy of
explanation; but the only direct information you ever get about them
is that they are not. This seems to block all avenues of
investigation, and presently you find yourself taking them as a
matter of course, like the Lion and Unicorn, or the image on a
stamp.</p>

<p>Fenwick accepted "the Major," as the old fossil was called, so
frankly and completely under that name that he was still uncertain
about his real designation at the current moment of the story.
Nobody ever called him anything but "the Major," and he would as
soon have asked "Major what?" as called in question the title of the
King of Hearts instead of playing him on the Queen, and taking the
trick. So far as he could conjecture, the Major had accepted him in
the same way. When the railway adventure was detailed to him, the
fossil said many times, "How <i>per</i>fectly extraordinary!" "God bless
my soul!" "You don't mean <i>that</i>!" and so on; but his astonishment
always knocked his double eyeglass off, and, when he couldn't find
it, it had to be recovered before he could say, "Eh&mdash;eh&mdash;what was
that?" and get in line again; so he made a disjointed listener.</p>

<p>But these fossils see more than they hear sometimes; and this old
Major, for all he was so silent, must have noticed many little
things that Christmas evening to cause him to say what he did next
day to Sally. For, of course, the Major couldn't go back to his
lodgings in Ball Street in weather like this; so he

<!-- Page 54 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
stayed the
night in the spare room, where Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick had been put up tempory,
cook said&mdash;a room which was, in fact, usually spoken of as "the
Major's room."</p>

<p>Of course, Sally was the sort of girl who would never see anything
of that sort&mdash;you'll see what sort directly&mdash;though she was as sharp
as a razor in a general way. What made her blind in this case was
that, in certain things, aspects, relations of life, she had ruled
mother out of court as an intrinsically grown-up person&mdash;one to whom
some speculations would not apply. So she saw nothing in the fact
that when Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's knock came at the door, her mother said,
"There he is," and went out to meet him; nor even in her stopping
with him outside on the landing, chatting confidentially and
laughing. Why shouldn't she?</p>

<p>She saw nothing&mdash;nothing whatever&mdash;in Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's bringing her
mother a beautiful sealskin jacket as a Christmas present. Why
shouldn't he? The only thing that puzzled Sally was, where on earth
did he get the money to buy it? But then, of course, he was "in the
City," and the City is a sort of Tom Tiddler's ground. Sally found
that enough, on reflection.</p>

<p>She saw nothing, either, in her mother's carrying her present away
upstairs, and saying nothing about it till afterwards. Nor did she
notice any abnormal satisfaction on Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's countenance as he
came into the drawing-room by himself, such as one might discern in
a hen&mdash;if hens had countenances&mdash;after a special egg. Nor did she
attach any particular meaning to an expression on the elderly face
of the doctor's mother that any student of Lavater would at once
have seen to mean that <i>we</i> saw what was going on, but were going to
be maternally discreet about it, and only mention it to every one we
met in the very strictest confidence. This lady, who had rather
reluctantly joined the party&mdash;for she was a martyr to ailments&mdash;was
somewhat grudgingly admitted by Sally to be a comfortable sort of
old thing enough, if only she didn't "goozle" over you so. She had
no <i>locus standi</i> for goozling, whatever it was; for had not Sally
as good as told her son that she didn't want to marry him or anybody
else? If you ask us what would be the connecting link between
Sally's attitude towards the doctor and the goozlings of a third
party, we have no answer ready.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
</div>

<p>No; Sally went to bed as wise as ever&mdash;so she afterwards told the
fossil Major&mdash;at the end of the evening. She had enjoyed herself
immensely, though the simple material for rapture was only
foursquare Halma played by the four acuter intelligences of the six,
and draughts for the goozler and the fossil. But then Sally had a
rare faculty for enjoying herself, and she was perfectly contented
with only one admirer to torment, though he was only old Prosy, as
she called him, but not to his face. She was jolly glad mother had
put on her maroon-coloured watered silk with velvet facings, because
you couldn't deny that she looked lovely in it. And as for Mr.
Fenwick, he looked just like Hercules and Sir Walter Raleigh, after
being out skating all day long in the cold. And Sally's wisdom had
not been in the least increased by what was, after all, only a
scientific experiment on poor Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's mental torpor when her
mother, the goozler and old Prosy having departed, got out her music
to sing that very old song of hers to him that he had thought the
other day seemed to bring back a sort of memory of something. Was it
not possible that if he heard it often enough his past might revive
slowly? You never could tell!</p>

<p>So when, on Boxing Day morning, Sally's mother, who had got down
early and hurried her breakfast to make a dash for early prayer at
St.&nbsp;Satisfax, looked in at her backward daughter and reproached her,
and said there was the Major coming down, and no one to get him his
chocolate, she spoke to a young lady who was serenely unprepared for
any revelations of a startling nature, or, indeed, any revelations
at all. Nor did getting the Major his chocolate excite any
suspicions.</p>

<p>So Sally was truly taken aback when the old gentleman, having drunk
his chocolate, broke a silence which had lasted since a brief and
fossil-like good-morning, with, "Well, missy, and what do <i>you</i> say
to the idea of a stepfather?" But not immediately, for at first she
didn't understand him, and answered placidly: "It depends on who."</p>

<p>"Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick, for instance!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but who for? And stepfather to step-what? Stepdaughter or
stepson?"</p>

<p>"Yourself, little goose! <i>You</i> would be the stepdaughter."</p>

<p>Sally was then so taken aback that she could make nothing of it,

<!-- Page 56 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
but stood in a cloud of mystification. The major had to help her.
"How would you like your mother to marry Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick?" He was one of
those useful people who never <i>finesse</i>, who let you know
point-blank where you are, and to whom you feel so grateful for
being unfeeling. While others there be who keep you dancing about in
suspense, while they break things gently, and all the while are
scoring up a little account against you for considerateness.</p>

<p>Sally's bewilderment, however, recognised one thing distinctly&mdash;that
the Major's inquiry was not to get, but to give, information. He
didn't the least want to know what <i>she</i> thought; he was only
working to give her a useful tip. So she would take her time about
answering. She took it, looking as grave as a little downy owl-tot.
Meanwhile, to show there was no bad feeling, she went and sat
candidly on the fossil's knee, and attended to his old whiskers and
moustache.</p>

<p>"Major dear!" said she presently.</p>

<p>"What, my child?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't they make an awfully handsome couple?" The Major replied,
"Handsome is as handsome does," and seemed to suggest that questions
of this sort belonged to a pre-fossilised condition of existence.</p>

<p>"Now, Major dear, why not admit it when you know it's true? You know
quite well they would make a lovely couple. Just fancy them going up
the aisle at St.&nbsp;Satisfax! It would be like medi&aelig;val Kings and
Queens." For Sally was still in that happy phase of girlhood in
which a marriage is a wedding, <i>et pr&aelig;terea aliquid</i>, but not much.
"But," she continued, "I couldn't give up any of mamma&mdash;no, not so
much as <i>that</i>&mdash;if she was to marry twenty Mr.&nbsp;Fenwicks." As the
quantity indicated was the smallest little finger-end that could be
checked off with a thumb-nail, the twenty husbands would have come
in for a very poor allowance of matrimony. The Major didn't seem to
think the method of estimation supplied a safe ground for
discussion, and allowed it to lapse.</p>

<p>"I may be quite wrong, you know, my dear," said he. "I dare say I'm
only an old fool. So we won't say anything to mamma, will us, little
woman?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Major dear. I'll promise not to say anything to

<!-- Page 57 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
her
<i>because</i> of what you've said to me. But if I suspect it myself on
my account later on, of course I shall."</p>

<p>"What shall you say to her?"</p>

<p>"Ask her if it's true! Why not? But what was it made <i>you</i> think
so?" Whereon the Major gave in detail his impressions of the little
incidents recorded above, which Sally had seen nothing in. He laid a
good deal of stress on the fact that her mother had suppressed the
Christmas present until after Dr.&nbsp;Vereker and his mother had
departed. She wouldn't have minded the doctor, he said, but she
would naturally want to keep the old bird out of the swim. Besides,
there was Fenwick himself&mdash;one could see what <i>he</i> thought of it!
She could perfectly well stop him if she chose, and she didn't
choose.</p>

<p>"Stop his whatting?" asked Sally perplexingly. But she admitted the
possibility of an answer by not pressing the question home. Then she
went on to say that all these things had happened exactly under her
nose, and she had never seen anything in them. The only concession
she was inclined to make was in respect of the impression her mother
evidently made on Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick. But that was nothing wonderful.
Anything else would have been very surprising. Only it didn't follow
from that that mother wanted to marry Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick, or Mr.&nbsp;Anybody.
As far as he himself went, she liked him awfully&mdash;but then he
couldn't recollect who he was, poor fellow! It was most pathetic
sometimes to see him trying. If only he could have remembered that
he hadn't been a pirate, or a forger, or a wicked Marquis! But to
know absolutely nothing at all about himself! Why, the only thing
that was known now about his past life was that he once knew a
Rosalind Nightingale&mdash;what he said to her in the railway-carriage.
And now he had forgotten that, too, like everything else.</p>

<p>"I say, Major dear"&mdash;Sally has an influx of a new idea&mdash;"it ought to
be possible to find out something about that Rosalind Nightingale he
knew. Mamma says it's nonsense her being any relation, because she'd
know."</p>

<p>"And suppose we did find out who she was?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, if we could get at her, we might get her to tell us who
he was. And then we could tell him."</p>

<p>Perhaps it is only his fossil-like way of treating the subject, but

<!-- Page 58 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
certainly the Major shows a very slack interest, Sally thinks, in
the identity of this namesake of hers. He does, however, ask
absently, what sort of way did he speak of her in the train?</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;he said so little&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he gave you some impression?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course. He spoke as if she was a person&mdash;not a female you
know&mdash;a person!"</p>

<p>"A person isn't a female&mdash;when? Eh, missy?" This requires a little
consideration, and gets it. The result, when it comes, seems good in
its author's eyes.</p>

<p>"When they sit down. When you ask them to, you know. In the parlour,
I mean&mdash;not the hall. They might be a female then."</p>

<p>"Did he mean a lady?"</p>

<p>"And take milk and no sugar? And pull her gloves on to go? And leave
cards turned up at the corner? Oh no&mdash;not a lady, certainly!"</p>

<p>As she makes these instructive distinctions, Miss Sally is kneeling
on a hassock before a mature fire, which will tumble down and spoil
presently. When it does it will be time to resort to that
hearth-broom, and restrict combustion with collected caput-mortuum
of Derby-Brights, selected, twenty-seven shillings. Till then,
Sally, who deserted the Major's knee just as she asked what Mr.
Fenwick was to stop in, is at liberty to roast, and does so with
undisturbed gravity. The Major is becoming conscious of a smell like
Joan of Arc at the beginning of the entertainment, when her mother
comes in on a high moral platform, and taxes her with singeing, and
dissolves the parliament, and rings to take away breakfast, and
forecasts an open window the minute the Major has gone.</p>

<p>Sally doesn't wait for the open window, but as one recalled to the
active duties of life from liquefaction in a Turkish bath, takes a
cold plunge as far as the front gate without so much as a hat on&mdash;to
see if the post is coming, which is absurd&mdash;and comes back braced.
But though she only wonders what can have put such an idea as her
mother marrying Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick in the Major's dear silly old head, she
keeps on a steady current of speculation about who that Rosalind
Nightingale he knew could possibly have been; and whether she
couldn't be got at even now. It was

<!-- Page 59 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
such a pity he couldn't have a
tip given about him who he was. If he were once started, he would
soon run; she was sure of that. But did he want to run?&mdash;that was a
point to consider. Did he really forget as much as he said he did?
How came he not to have forgotten his languages he was so fluent
with? And how about his book-keeping? And that curious way he had of
knowing about places, and then looking puzzled when asked when he
had been there. When they talked about Klondyke the other day, for
instance, and he seemed to know so much about it.... But, then, see
how he grasped his head, and ruffled his hair, and shut his eyes,
and clenched his teeth over his efforts to recollect whether he had
really been there himself, or only read it all in the "Century" or
"Atlantic Monthly"! Surely he was in earnest then.</p>

<p>Sally's speculations lasted her all the way to No. 260, Ladbroke
Grove Road, where she was going to a music-lesson, or rather
music-practice, with a friend who played the violin; for Sally was
learning the viola&mdash;to be useful.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="subhead">CONCERNING PEOPLE'S PASTS, AND THE SEPARATION OF THE SHEEP FROM THE
GOATS. OF YET ANOTHER MAJOR, AND HOW HE GOSSIPPED AT THE HURKARU
CLUB. SOME TRUSTWORTHY INFORMATION ABOUT AN ALLEGED DIVORCE</p>

<p>You who read this may have met with some cross-chance such as we are
going to try to describe to you; possibly with the same effect upon
yourself as the one we have to confess to in our own case&mdash;namely,
that you have been left face to face with a problem to which you
have never been able to supply a solution. You have given up a
conundrum in despair, and no one has told you the answer.</p>

<p>Here are the particulars of an imaginary case of the sort. You have
made acquaintance&mdash;made friends&mdash;years ago with some man or woman
without any special introduction, and without feeling any particular
curiosity about his or her antecedents. No inquiry seemed to be
called for; all concomitants were so very usual. You may have felt a
misgiving as to whether the easy-going ways of your old papa, or the
innocent Bohemianisms of his sons and daughters will be welcome to
your new friend, whom you credit with being a little old-fashioned
and strait-laced, if anything. But it never occurs to you to doubt
or investigate; why should you, when no question is raised of any
great intimacy between you and the So-and-sos, which may stand for
the name of his or her family. They ask no certificate from you, of
whom they know just as little. Why should you demand credentials of
a passer-by because he is so obliging as to offer to lend you a
Chinese vocabulary or Whitaker? Why should your wife try to go
behind the cheque-book and the prayer-book of a married couple when
all she has had to do with the lady was, suppose, to borrow a square
bottle of her, marked off in half-inch lengths, to be shaken before
taken? Why not accept her unimpeachable Sunday morning as sufficient
warranty for

<!-- Page 61 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
talking to her on the beach next day, and finding what
a very nice person she is? Because it would very likely be at the
seaside. But suppose any sort of introduction of this sort&mdash;you know
what we mean!</p>

<p>Well, the So-and-sos have slipped gradually into your life; let this
be granted. We need not imagine, for our purpose, any extreme
approaches of family intimacy, any love affairs or deadly quarrels.
A tranquil intercourse of some twenty years is all we need, every
year of which has added to your conviction of the thorough
trustworthiness and respectability of the So-and-sos, of their
readiness to help you in any little difficulty, and of the high
opinion which the rest of the world has of Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.
So-and-so&mdash;the world which knew them when it was a boy, and all
their connexions and antecedents, which, you admit, you didn't....</p>

<p>And then, after all these years, it is suddenly burst upon you that
there was a shady story about So-and-so that never was cleared
up&mdash;something about money, perhaps; or, worse still, one of those
stories your informant really doesn't like to be responsible for the
particulars of; you must ask Smith yourself. Or your wife comes to
you in fury and indignation that such a scandalous falsehood should
have got about as that Clara So-and-so was never married to
So-and-so at all till ever so long after Fluffy or Toppy or Croppy
or Poppy was born! We take any names at random of this sort, merely
to dwell on your good lady's familiarity with the So-and-so family.</p>

<p>Well, then&mdash;there you are! And what can you make of it? There you
are face to face with the fact that a man who was a black sheep
twenty or thirty years ago has been all this time making believe to
be a white sheep so successfully as never was. Or, stranger still,
that a woman who has brought up a family of model
daughters&mdash;daughters whom it would be no exaggeration to speak of as
on all fours with your own, and who is quite one of the nicest and
most sympathetic people your wife has to go to in trouble&mdash;this
woman actually&mdash;<i>actually</i>&mdash;if this tale is true, was guilty in her
youth ... there&mdash;that will do! Suppose we say she was no better than
she should be. She hadn't even the decency to be a married woman
before she did it, which always makes it so much easier to talk to
strange ladies and girls about

<!-- Page 62 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
it. You can say all the way down a
full dinner-table that Lady Polly Andrews got into the Divorce Court
without doing violence to any propriety at all. But the story of
Mrs.&nbsp;So-and-so's indiscretion while still Miss Such-and-such must be
talked of more guardedly.</p>

<p>And all the while behold the subjects of these stories, in whom, but
for this sudden revelation of a shady past, you can detect no moral
difference from your amiable and respectable self! They puzzle you,
as they puzzle us, with a doubt whether they really are the same
people; whether they have not changed their identity since the days
of their delinquency. If they really are the same, it almost throws
a doubt on how far the permanent unforgiveness of sins is expedient.
We of course refer to Human Expediency only&mdash;the construction of a
working hypothesis of Life, that would favour peace on earth and
good-will towards men; that would establish a <i>modus vivendi</i>, and
enable us to be jolly with these reprobates&mdash;at any rate, as soon as
they had served their time and picked their oakum. We are not
intruding on the province of the Theologian&mdash;merely discussing the
problem of how we can make ourselves pleasant to one another all
round, until that final separation of the sheep from the goats,
when, however carefully they may have patched up their own little
quarrels, they will have to bid each other farewell reluctantly, and
make up their minds to the permanent endurance of Heaven and Hell
respectively.</p>

<p>We confess that we ourselves think there ought to be a Statute of
Limitations, and that after a certain lapse of time any offence,
however bad, against morality might be held not to have been
committed. If we feel this about culprits who tempted us, at the
time of their enormity, to put in every honest hand a whip to lash
the rascal naked the length of a couple of lamp-posts, how much more
when the offence has been one which our own sense of moral law (a
perverted one, we admit) scarcely recognises as any offence at all.
And how much more yet, when we find it hard to believe that
they&mdash;actually <i>they themselves</i>, that we know now&mdash;can have done
the things imputed to them. If the stories are really true, were
they not possessed by evil spirits? Or have they since come to be
possessed by better ones than their normal stock-in-trade?</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
</div>

<p>What is all this prosy speculation about? Well, it's about our
friend in the last chapter, Sally's mother. At least, it is
suggested by her. She is one of those perplexing cases we have
hinted at, and we acknowledge ourselves unable to account for her at
the date of the story, knowing what we do of her twenty years
previously. It's little enough, mind, and much of it inferential.
Suppose, instead of giving you our inferences, we content ourselves
with passing on to you the data on which we found them. Maybe you
will see your way to some different life-history for Sally's mother.</p>

<p>The first insight we had into her past was supplied by a friend of
Sally's "old fossil," who was himself a Major, but with a
difference. For he was really a Major, whereas the fossil was only
called so by Krakatoa Villa, being in truth a Colonel. This one was
Major Roper, of the Hurkaru Club, an old schoolfellow of ours, who
was giving us a cup of coffee and a cigar at the said Club, and
talking himself hoarse about Society. When the Major gets hoarse his
voice rises to a squeak, and his eyes start out of his head, and he
appears to swell. I forget how Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale came into the
conversation, but she did, somehow.</p>

<p>"She's a very charming woman, that," squeaked the Major&mdash;"a <i>very</i>
charming woman! I don't mind tellin' <i>you</i>, you know, that I knew
her at Madras&mdash;ah! before the divorce. I wouldn't tell Horrocks, nor
that dam young fool Silcox, but I don't mind tellin' <i>you</i>! Only,
look here, my dear boy, don't you go puttin' it about that <i>I</i> told
you anythin'. You know I make it a rule&mdash;a guidin' rule&mdash;<i>never to
say anythin'</i>. You follow that rule through life, my boy! Take the
word of an old chap that's seen a deal of service, and just you
<i>hold your tongue</i>! You make a point&mdash;you'll find it pay&mdash;&mdash;" An
asthmatic cough came in here.</p>

<p>"There was a divorce, then?" we said. Terms had to be made with the
cough, but speech came in the end.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, of course&mdash;of course! Don't mind repeatin' that&mdash;thing was
in the papers at the time. What I was suggestin' holdin' your tongue
about was that story about Penderfield and her.... Well, as I said
just now, I don't mind repeatin' it to you; you ain't Horrocks nor
little Silcox&mdash;you can keep your tongue in your head. Remember, <i>I</i>
know nothing; I'm only tellin'

<!-- Page 64 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
what was said at the time.... Now,
whatever was her name? Was it Rayner, or was it Verschoyle?
Pelloo!... Pelloo!..." The Major tried to call the attention of a
man who was deep in an Oriental newspaper at the far end of the next
room. But when the Major overstrains his voice, it misses fire like
a costermonger's, and only a falsetto note comes on a high register.
When this happens he is wroth.</p>

<p>"It's that dam noise they're all makin'," he says, as soon as he has
become articulate. "That's the man I want, behind the 'Daily
Sunderbund.' If it wasn't for this dam toe, I'd go across and ask
him. No, don't you go. Send one of these dam jumpin' frogs&mdash;idlin'
about!" He requisitions a passing waiter, gripping him by the arm to
give him instructions. "Just&mdash;you&mdash;touch the General's arm, and
ketch his attention. Say Major Roper." And he liquidates his
obligations to a great deal of asthmatic cough, while the jumping
frog does his bidding.</p>

<p>The General (who is now Lord Pellew of Cutch, by-the-bye) came with
an amiable smile from behind the journal, and ended a succession of
good-evening nods to newcomers by casting an anchor opposite the
Major. The latter, having by now taken the surest steps towards
bringing the whole room into his confidence, stated the case he
sought confirmation for.</p>

<p>Oh yes, certainly; the General was in Umballa in '80; remembered the
young lady quite well, and the row between Penderfield and his wife
about her. As for Penderfield, everybody remembered <i>him</i>! <i>De
mortuis nil</i>, etc.&mdash;of course, of course. For all that, he was one
of the damnedest scoundrels that ever deserved to be turned out of
the service. Ought to have been cashiered long ago. Good job he's
gone to the devil! Yes, he was quite sure he was remembering the
right girl. No, no, he wasn't thinking of Daisy Neversedge&mdash;no, nor
of little Miss Wrennick: same sort of story, but he wasn't thinking
of them at all. Only the name wasn't either Rayner or Verschoyle.
General Pellew stood thoughtfully feeling about in a memory at
fault, and looking at an unlighted cigar he rolled in his fingers,
as though it might help if caressed. Then he had a flash of
illumination. "Rosalind Graythorpe," he said.</p>

<p>There we had it, sure enough! The Major see-sawed in the air with a
finger of sudden corroboration. "Rosalind Graythorpe,"

<!-- Page 65 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
he repeated
triumphantly, and then again, "Ros-a-lind Graythorpe," dwelling on
the syllables, and driving the name home, as it were, to the
apprehension of all within hearing. It was so necessary to a
complete confidence that every one should know whom he was holding
his tongue about. Where would be the merit of discretion else? But
the enjoyment of details should be <i>sotto voce</i>. The General dropped
his voice to a good sample, suggesting a like course to the more
demonstrative secrecy of the Major.</p>

<p>"I remember the whole story quite well," said he. "The girl was
going out by herself to marry a young fellow up the country at
Umballa, I think. They were <i>fianc&eacute;s</i>, and on the way the news came
of the outbreak of cholera. So she got hung up for a while at
Penderfield's&mdash;sort of cousin, I believe, him or his wife&mdash;till the
district was sanitary again. Bad job for her, as it turned out!
Nobody there to warn her what sort of fellow Penderfield was&mdash;and if
there had been she wouldn't have believed 'em. She was a madcap sort
of a girl, and regularly in the hands of about as bad a couple as
you'll meet with in a long spell&mdash;India or anywhere! They used to
say out there that the she Penderfield winked at all her husband's
affairs as long as he didn't cut across <i>her</i> little
arrangements&mdash;did more than wink, in fact&mdash;lent a helping hand; but
only as long as she could rely on his remaining detached, as you
might say. The moment she suspected an <i>entichement</i> on her
husband's part she was up in arms. And he was just the same about
her. I remember Lady Sharp saying that if Penderfield had suspected
his wife of caring about any of her co-respondents he would have
divorced her at once. They were a rum couple, but their attitude to
one another was the only good thing about them." The General lighted
his cigar, and seemed to consider this was chapter one. The Major
appended a foot-note, for our benefit.</p>

<p>"<i>Leave be</i> was the word&mdash;the word for Penderfield. <i>You'll</i>
understand that, sir. No <i>meddlin'</i>! A good-lookin' Colonel's wife
in garrison has her choice, good Lard! Why, she's only got to hold
her finger up!" We entirely appreciated the position, and that a
siren has a much easier task in the entanglement of a confiding
dragoon than falls to the lot of Don Giovanni in the reverse case.
But we were more interested in the particular

<!-- Page 66 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
story of Mrs.
Nightingale than in the general ethics of profligacy.</p>

<p>"I suppose," we suggested, "that the young woman threatened to be a
formidable rival, as there was a row?" Each of the officers nodded
at the other, and said that was about it. The Major then started on
a little private curriculum of nods on his own account, backed by a
half-closed eye of superhuman subtlety, and added once or twice that
that <i>was</i> about it. We inferred from this that the row had been
volcanic in character. The Major then added, repeating the
air-sawing action of his forefinger admonitorily, "But mind you, <i>I</i>
say nothin'. And my recommendation to you is to say nothin'
neither."</p>

<p>"The rest of the story's soon told," said the General, answering our
look of inquiry. "Miss Graythorpe went away to Umballa to be
married. It was all gossip, mind you, about herself and Penderfield.
But gossip always went one way about any girl he was seen with. I
have my own belief; so has Jack Roper." The Major underwent a
perfect convulsion of nods, winks, and acquiescence. "Well, she went
away, and was married to this young shaver, who was very little over
twenty. He wasn't in the service&mdash;civil appointment, I think. How
long was it, Major, before they parted? Do you recollect?"</p>

<p>"Week&mdash;ten days&mdash;month&mdash;six weeks! Couldn't say. They didn't part at
the church door; that's all I could say for certain. Tell him the
rest."</p>

<p>"They certainly parted very soon, and people told all sorts of
stories. The stories got fewer and clearer when it came out that the
young woman was in the family way. No one had any right <i>then</i> to
ascribe the child that was on its road to any father except the
young man she had fallen out with. But they did&mdash;it was laid at
Colonel Penderfield's door, before there was any sufficient warrant.
However, it was all clear enough when the child was born."</p>

<p>"When was the divorce?"</p>

<p>"He applied for a divorce a twelvemonth after the marriage. The
child was then spoken of as being four months old. My impression is
he did not succeed in getting a divorce."</p>

<p>"Not he," said the Major, overtopping the General's quiet,
restrained voice with his falsetto. "I recollect <i>that</i>, bless you!
The

<!-- Page 67 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Court commiserated him, but couldn't give him any relief. So he
made a bolt of it. And he's never been heard of since, as far as I
know."</p>

<p>"What did the mother do? Where did she go?" we asked.</p>

<p>"Well, she might have been hard put to it to know what to do. But
she met with old Lund&mdash;Carrington Lund, you know, not Beauchamp;
he'd a civil appointment at Umritsur&mdash;comes here sometimes. You know
him? She's his Rosey he talks about. He was an old friend of her
father, and took her in and protected her&mdash;saw her through it. She
came with him to England. I was with them on the boat, part of the
way. Then she took the name of Macnaghten, I believe. The young
husband's name I can't remember the least. But it wasn't
Macnaghten."</p>

<p>The Major squeaked in again:</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nor hers neither! Nightingale, General&mdash;that's the name she
goes by. Friend of this gentleman. Very charmin' person indeed!
Introdooce you? And a very charmin' little daughter, goin'
nineteen." The two officers interchanged glances over our young
friend Sally. "She was a nice baby on the boat," said the General;
and the Major chuckled wheezily, and hoped she didn't take after her
father.</p>

<p>We left him to the tender mercies of gout and asthma, and the
enjoyment of a sherry-cobbler through a straw, looking rather too
fat for his snuff-coloured trousers with a cord outside, and his
flowered silk waistcoat; but very much too fat for the straw, the
slenderness of which was almost painful by contrast.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Perhaps you will see from this why we hinted at the outset of this
chapter why Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale was a conundrum we had given up in
despair, of which no one had told us the answer. We wanted your
sympathy, you see, and to get it have given you an insight into the
way our information was gleaned. Having given you this sample, we
will now return to simple narrative of what we know of the true
story, and trouble you with no further details of how we came by it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="subhead">THE ANTECEDENTS OF ROSALIND NIGHTINGALE, SALLY'S MOTHER. HOW BOTH
CAME FROM INDIA TO ENGLAND, AND TOOK A VILLA ON A REPAIRING LEASE.
SOMEWHAT OF SALLY'S UPBRINGING. SOME MORE ROPER GOSSIP, AND A CAT
LET OUT OF A BAG. A PIECE OF PRESENCE OF&nbsp;MIND</p>

<p>Sally Graythorpe (our Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale) was the daughter of a
widowed mother, also called Sally, the name in both cases being (as
in that of her daughter whom we know) Rosalind, not Sarah. This
mother married <i>en secondes noces</i> a former sweetheart; it had been
a case of a match opposed by parents on the ground of the apparent
hopelessness of the young man's prospects. Mr.&nbsp;Paul Nightingale,
however, falsified the doleful predictions about his future by
becoming a successful leader-writer and war correspondent. It was
after the close of the American Civil War, in which he had gained a
good deal of distinction, that he met at Saratoga his old flame,
Mrs.&nbsp;Graythorpe, then a widow with a little daughter five or six
years old. Having then no wishes to consult but their own, and no
reason to the contrary appearing, they were married.</p>

<p>They did not find the States a pleasant domicile in the early days
following the great war, and came to England. The little daughter
soon became like his own child to Mr.&nbsp;Paul Nightingale, and had his
wish been complied with she would have taken his name during his
life. But her mother saw no reason, apparently, for extinguishing
Mr.&nbsp;Graythorpe <i>in toto</i>, and she remained Sally Graythorpe.</p>

<p>Miss Graythorpe was, at a guess, about fifteen when her stepfather
died. Her mother, now for the second time a widow, must have been
very comfortably off, as she had an income of her own as well as a
life-interest in her late husband's invested savings, which was
unfettered by any conditions as to her marrying again, or otherwise.
She was not long in availing herself of

<!-- Page 69 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
this liberty; for about the
time when her daughter was of an age to be engaged on her own
account, she accepted a third offer of marriage&mdash;this time from a
clergyman, who, like herself, had already stood by the death-beds of
two former mates, and was qualified to sympathize with her in every
way, including comfortable inheritances.</p>

<p>But the young Sally Graythorpe kicked furiously against this new
arrangement. It was an insult to papa (she referred to Mr.
Nightingale; her real papa was a negligible factor), and she
wouldn't live in the same house with that canting old hypocrite. She
would go away straight to India, and marry Gerry&mdash;<i>he</i> would be glad
enough to have her&mdash;see how constant the dear good boy had been! Not
a week passed but she got a letter. She asked her mother flatly what
could she want to marry again for at her time of life? And such a
withered old sow-thistle as that! Sub-dean, indeed! She would
<i>sub-dean</i> him! In fact, there were words, and the words almost went
the length of taking the form known as "language" <i>par excellence</i>.
The fact is, this Sally and her mother never <i>did</i> get on together
well; it wasn't the least like her subsequent relation with our
special Sally&mdash;Sally number three&mdash;who trod on Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick in the
Twopenny Tube.</p>

<p>The end of the "words" was a letter to Gerry, a liberal trousseau,
and a first-class passage out by P. and O. The young lady's luggage
for the baggage-room was beautifully stencilled "Care of Sir
Oughtred Penderfield, The Residency, Khopal." Perfectly safe in his
keeping no doubt it would have been. But, then, that might have been
true also of luggage if consigned to the Devil. If the tale hinted
at in our last chapter <i>was</i> true, its poor little headstrong,
inexperienced heroine would have been about as safe with the latter.</p>

<p>Anyhow, this club gossip supplies all the broad outline of the
story; and it is a story we need not dwell on. It gives us no means
of reconciling the like of the Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale we know now with the
amount of dissimulation, if not treachery, she must have practised
on an unsuspicious boy, assuming that she did, as a matter of
course, conceal her relation with Penderfield. One timid conjecture
we have is, that the girl, having to deal with a subject every
accepted phrase relating to which is an equivocation or an
hypocrisy, really found it impossible to make her position

<!-- Page 70 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
understood by a lover who simply idolized the ground she trod on.
Under such circumstances, she may either have given up the attempt
in despair, or jumped too quickly to the conclusion that she had
succeeded in communicating the facts, and had been met half-way by
forgiveness. Put yourself in her position, and resolve in your mind
exactly how you would have gone about it&mdash;how you would have got a
story of that sort forced into the mind of a welcoming lover; wedged
into the heart of his unsuspicious rapture. Or, if you fancied he
understood you, and no storm of despairing indignation came, think
how easy it would be to persuade yourself you had done your duty by
the facts, and might let the matter lapse! Why should not one woman
once take advantage of the obscurities of decorum so many a man has
found comforting to his soul during confession of sin, when pouring
his revelations into an ear whose owner's experience of life has not
qualified her to understand them. Think of the difficulty you
yourself have encountered in getting at the absolute facts in some
delicate concurrence of circumstances in this connexion, because of
the fundamental impossibility of getting any one, man or woman, to
speak direct truth!</p>

<p>Let us find out, or construct, all the excuses we can for poor Miss
Graythorpe. Let us imagine the last counsel she had from the only
one of her own sex who would be likely to know anything of the
matter&mdash;the nefarious partner (if the Major's surmise was true) in
the crime of her betrayer. "You are making a fuss about nothing. Men
are not so immaculate themselves; your Gerry is no Joseph! If he
rides the high horse with you, just you ask him what <i>he</i> had to say
to Potiphar's wife! Oh, we're not so strait-laced out here&mdash;bless us
alive!&mdash;as we are in England, or pretend to be." We can fancy the
elegant brute saying it.</p>

<p>All our surmises bring us very little light, though. It is not that
we are at such a loss to forgive poor Sally Graythorpe as a mere
human creature we know nothing about. The difficulty is to reconcile
what she seems to have been then with what she is now. We give it
up.</p>

<p>Only, we wish to remark that it is her offence against her <i>fianc&eacute;</i>
alone that we find it hard to stomach. As to her relations with
Colonel Penderfield, we can say nothing without full particulars.

<!-- Page 71 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
And even if we had them, and they bore hard upon Miss Graythorpe,
our mind would go back to the Temple in Jerusalem, and a morning
nearly two thousand years ago. The voice that said who was to cast
the first stone is heard no more, or has merged in ritual. But the
Scribes and Pharisees are with us still, and quite ready to do the
pelting. We should be harder on the Colonel, no doubt, with our
prejudices; only, observe! he isn't brought up for judgment. He
never is, any more than the other party was that day in Jerusalem.
But, then, the Scribes and Pharisees were male! And they had the
courage of their convictions&mdash;their previous convictions!&mdash;and acted
on them in their selection of the culprit.</p>

<p>Without further apology for retailing conjecture as certainty, the
following may be taken as substantially the story of this lady&mdash;we
do not know whether to call her a divorced or a deserted wife&mdash;and
her little encumbrance.</p>

<p>She found a resource in her trouble in the person of this old friend
of her stepfather Paul Nightingale, Colonel (at that time Major)
Lund. This officer had remained on in harness to the unusual age of
fifty-eight, but it was a civil appointment he held; he had retired
from active service in the ordinary course of things. It was
probably not only because of his old friendship for her stepfather,
but because the poor girl told him her unvarnished tale in full and
he believed it, that he helped and protected her through the
critical period that followed her parting from her husband; found
her a domicile and seclusion, and enlisted on her behalf the
sympathies of more than one officer's wife at our Sally's
birth-place&mdash;Umritsur, if Major Roper was right. He corresponded
with her mother as intercessor and mediator, but that good lady was
in no mood for mercy: had her daughter not told her that she was too
old to think of marriage? Too old! And had she not called her
venerable sub-dean a withered old sow-thistle? She could forgive,
under guarantees of the sinner's repentance; for had not her Lord
enjoined forgiveness where the bail tendered was sufficient? Only,
so many reservations and qualifications occurred in her
interpretations of the Gospel narrative that forgiveness, diluted
out of all knowledge, left its perpetrator free to refuse ever to
see its victim again. But she would pray for her. A subdiaconal
application would

<!-- Page 72 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
receive attention; that was the suggestion
between the lines.</p>

<p>The kind-hearted old soldier pooh-poohed her first letters. She
would come round in time. Her natural good-feeling would get the
better of her when she had had her religious fling. He didn't put it
so&mdash;a strict old Puritan of the old school&mdash;but that was Miss
Graythorpe's gloss in her own mind on what he did say. However, her
mother never did come round. She cherished her condemnation of her
daughter to the end, forgiving her again <i>mor&ecirc; suo</i>, if anything
with increased asperity, on her death-bed.</p>

<p>This Colonel Lund is (have we mentioned this before?) the "old
fossil" whom we have seen at Krakatoa Villa. He was usually called
"the Major" there, from early association. He continued to foster
and shelter his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i> during the year following the arrival of
our own particular young Sally on the scene, saw her safely through
her divorce proceedings, and then, when he finally retired from his
post as deputy commissioner for the Umritsur district, arranged that
she herself, with her encumbrance and an ayah, should accompany him
to England. His companion travelled as Mrs.&nbsp;Graythorpe, and Sally
junior as Mrs.&nbsp;Graythorpe's baby. She was excessively popular on the
voyage; Sally was not suffering from sea-sickness, or feeling
apparently the least embarrassed by the recent bar-sinister in her
family. She courted Society, seizing it by its whiskers or its
curls, and holding on like grim death. She endeavoured successively
to get into the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the
Mediterranean, and the Atlantic, but failed in every attempt, and
was finally landed at Southampton in safety, after a resolute effort
to drag the captain, who was six feet three high and weighed twenty
stone, ashore by his beard. She was greatly missed on the remainder
of the voyage (to Bremen&mdash;the boat was a German boat) by a family of
Vons, who fortunately never guessed at the flaw in Sally's
extraction, or there's no knowing what might not have happened.</p>

<p>But the arrival was too late for her poor mother to utilise her
services towards a reconciliation with her own offended parent. A
sudden attack of influenza, followed by low diet on high principles,
and uncombated by timely port wine and tonics, had been followed by
heart-failure, and the sub-dean was left free

<!-- Page 73 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
to marry again,
again. Whether he did so or not doesn't matter to us. The scheme
Mrs.&nbsp;Graythorpe had been dwelling on with pleasure through the
voyage of simply dropping her offspring on its grandmother, and
leaving it to drive a coach and six through the latter's Christian
forgiveness, was not to come to pass. She found herself after a year
and a half of Oriental life back in her native land, an orphan with
a small&mdash;but it must be admitted a very charming&mdash;illegitimate
family. It was hard upon her, for she had been building on the
success of this man&oelig;uvre, in which she had, perhaps, an
unreasonable confidence. If she could only rely on Sally not being
inopportunely sick over mamma just at the critical moment&mdash;that was
the only misgiving that crossed her mind. Otherwise, such creases
and such a hilarious laugh would be too much for starch itself. Poor
lady! she had thought to herself more than once, since Sally had
begun to mature and consolidate, that if Gerry had only waited a
little&mdash;just long enough to see what a little duck was going to come
of it all&mdash;and not lost his temper, all might have been made
comfortable, and Sally might have had a little legitimate
half-brother by now. What <i>had</i> become&mdash;what would become of Gerry?
That she did not know, might never know.</p>

<p>One little pleasant surprise awaited her. It came to her knowledge
for the first time that she was sole heir to the estate of her late
stepfather, Paul Nightingale. The singular practice that we believe
to exist in many families of keeping back all information about
testamentary dispositions as long as possible from the persons they
concern, especially minors, had been observed in her case; and her
mother, perhaps resenting the idea that her daughter&mdash;a young
chit!&mdash;should presume to outlive her, had kept her in ignorance of
the contents of her stepfather's will. It did not really matter
much. Had the sum been large, and a certainty, it might have
procured for her a safer position when a temporary guest at the
Residency at Khopal, or even caused her indignant young bridegroom
to think twice before he took steps to rid himself of her. But,
after all, it was only some three hundred and fifty pounds a year,
and depended on the life of a lady of forty-odd, who might live to
be a hundred. A girl with no more than that is nearly as defenceless
as she is without it.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 74 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
</div>

<p>A condition was attached to the bequest&mdash;not an unwelcome one. She
was to take her stepfather's name, Nightingale. She was really very
glad to do this. There was a <i>faux air</i> of a real married name about
Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale that was lacking in Mrs.&nbsp;Graythorpe. Besides, all
troublesome questions about who Sally's father was would get lost
sight of in the fact that her mother had changed her name in
connexion with that sacred and glorious thing, an inheritance. A
trust-fund would always be a splendid red-herring to draw across the
path of Mrs.&nbsp;Grundy's sleuth-hounds&mdash;a quarry more savoury to their
nostrils even than a reputation. And nothing soothes the sceptical
more than being asked now and again to witness a transfer of stock,
especially if it is money held in trust. It has all the force of a
pleasant alterative pill on the circulation of
Respectability&mdash;removes obstructions and promotes appetite&mdash;is a
certain remedy for sleeplessness, and so forth. So though there
wasn't a particle of reason why Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale's money should be
held by any one but herself, as she had no intention whatever of
marrying, Colonel Lund consented to become her trustee; and both
felt that something truly respectable had been done&mdash;something that
if it didn't establish a birthright and a correct extraction for
Miss Sally, at any rate went a long way towards it.</p>

<p>By the time Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale had got settled in the little house at
Shepherd's Bush, that she took on a twenty-one years' lease five or
six years after her return to England, and had christened it
Saratoga, after her early recollection of the place where she first
saw her stepfather, whose name she took when she came into the money
he left her&mdash;by this time she, with the assistance of Colonel Lund,
had quite assumed the appearance of a rather comfortably off young
widow-lady, who did not make a great parade of her widowhood, but
whose circumstances seemed reasonable enough, and challenged no
inquiry. Inquisitiveness would have seemed needless
impertinence&mdash;just as much so as yours would have been in the case
of the hypothetical So-and-sos at the beginning of our last chapter.
A vague impression got in the air that Sally's father had not been
altogether satisfactory&mdash;well, wasn't it true? It may have leaked
out from something in "the Major's" manner. But it never produced
any effect

<!-- Page 75 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
on friends, except that they saw in it a reason why Mrs.
Nightingale never mentioned her husband. He had been a black sheep.
Silence about him showed good feeling on her part. <i>De mortuis</i>,
etc....</p>

<p>Of one thing we feel quite certain&mdash;that if, at the time we made
this lady's acquaintance, any chance friend of hers or her
daughter's&mdash;say, for instance, L&aelig;titia Wilson, Sally's old
school-friend and present music-colleague&mdash;had been told that Mrs.
Nightingale, of Krakatoa Villa, No. 7, Glenmoira Road, Shepherd's
Bush, W., had been the heroine of divorce proceedings under queer
circumstances, that her husband wasn't dead at all, and that that
dear little puss Sally was Goodness-knows-who's child, we feel
certain that the information would have been cross-countered with a
blank stare of incredulity. Why, the mere fact that Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale
had refused so many offers of marriage was surely sufficient to
refute such a nonsensical idea! Who ever heard of a lady with a
soiled record refusing a good offer of marriage?</p>

<p>But while we are showing our respect for what the man in the street
says or thinks, and the woman in the street thinks and says, are we
not losing sight of a leading phrase of the symphony, sonata,
cantata&mdash;whatever you like to call it&mdash;of Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale's life? A
phrase that steals in, just audibly&mdash;no more, in the most
<i>strepitoso</i> passage of the stormy second movement&mdash;a movement,
however, in which the proceedings of the Divorce Court are scarcely
more audible, <i>pianissimo legato</i>, a chorus with closed lips, all
the stringed instruments <i>sordini</i>. But it grows and grows, and in
<i>allegro con fuoco</i> on the voyage home, and only leaves a bar or two
blank, when the thing it metaphorically represents is asleep and
isn't suffering from the wind. It breaks out again <i>vivacissimo
accelerando</i> when Miss Sally (whom we allude to) wakes up, and
doesn't appreciate Nestl&eacute;'s milk. But it always grows, and in due
course may be said to become the music itself.</p>

<p>More intelligibly, Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale became so wrapped up in her
baby, that had seemed to her at first a cruel embarrassment&mdash;a thing
to be concealed and ignored&mdash;that very soon she really had no time
to think about where she broke her molasses-jug, as Uncle Remus
says. The new life that it had become hers to guard

<!-- Page 76 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
took her out of
herself, made her quite another being from the reckless and
thoughtless girl of two years ago.</p>

<p>As time went on she felt more and more the value of the newcomer's
indifference to her extraction and the tragedy that had attended it.
A living creature, with a stupendous capacity for ignoring the past,
and, indeed, everything except a monotonous diet, naturally gave her
mind a bias towards the future, and hope grew in her heart
unconsciously, without reminding her that it might have been
despair. A bad alarm, when the creature was six months old, that an
enteric attack might end fatally, had revealed to its mother how
completely it had taken possession of her own life, and what a power
for compensation there was even in its most imperious and tyrannical
habits. As it gradually became articulate&mdash;however unreasonable it
continued&mdash;her interest in its future extinguished her memories of
her own past, and she found herself devising games for baby before
the little character was old enough to play them, and costumes
before she was big enough to wear them. By the time Saratoga Villa
had become Krakatoa, Miss Sally had had time to benefit by a
reasonable allowance of the many schemes her mother had developed
for her during her infancy. Had all the projects which were mooted
for her further education at this date been successfully carried
out, she would have been an admirable female Crichton, if her reason
had survived the curriculum. Luckily for her, she had a happy
faculty for being plucked at examinations, and her education was
consequently kept within reasonable bounds.</p>

<p>There was, however, one department of culture in which Sally outshot
all competitors. This was swimming. She would give a bath's length
at the Paddington Baths to the next strongest swimmer in the Ladies'
Club, and come in triumphant in a race of ten lengths. It was a
grand sight to see Sally rushing stem on, cleaving the water with
her head almost as if breath were an affectation, and doubling back
at the end while the other starters were scarcely half-way. Or
shooting through the air in her little blue costume straight for the
deepest water, and then making believe to be a fish on the shiny
tiles at the bottom.</p>

<p>Her mother always said she was certain that if that little monkey
had managed to wriggle through some hole into the sea, on

<!-- Page 77 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
her
voyage home, she would have swum after the ship and climbed up the
rudder chains. Possibly, but she was only twelve months old! If,
however, she had met with an early death, her mother's lot would
have lacked its redemption. The joint life of the two supplies a
possible answer to the conundrum that has puzzled us. For in a
certain sense the absorption of her own existence in that of another
than herself had made of Rosalind the woman, at the date of our
introduction to her, quite another person from Rosalind the
hot-headed and thoughtless girl that had quarrelled with her natural
guardian for doing what she had a perfect right to do, and had
steered alone into unknown seas, a ship without a rudder or a
compass, and very little knowledge of the stars of heaven for her
guide. We can see what she is now much better than we can judge what
she was then.</p>

<p>It need not be supposed that this poor lady never felt any interest,
never made any inquiry, about the sequel of the life she had so
completely <i>boulevers&eacute;</i>; for, whatever blame we feel bound to
express, or whatever exculpation we contrive to concoct for her,
there can be no doubt what the result was to the young man who has
come into the story, so far, only under the name of Gerry. We simply
record his designation as it has reached us in the data we are now
making use of. It is all hearsay about a past. We add what we have
been able to gather, merely noting that what it seems to point to
recommends itself to us as probable.</p>

<p>"Nobody knoo, nobody cared," was our friend Major Roper's brief
reply to an inquiry what became of this young man. "Why, good Lard,
sir!" he went on, "if one was to begin fussin' about all the
Johnnies that shy off when there's a row of that sort, one would
never get a dam night's rest! Not but what if I could recollect his
name. Now, what <i>was</i> his confounded name? Thought I'd got it&mdash;but
no&mdash;it wasn't Messiter. Fancy his Christian name was Jeremiah.... I
recollect Messiter I'm thinkin' of&mdash;character that looked as if he
had a pain in his stomach&mdash;came into forty thousand pounds. Stop a
bit&mdash;was it Indermaur? No, it wasn't Indermaur. No use
guessin'&mdash;give it up."</p>

<p>Besides, the Major was getting purple with suppressed coughing.

<!-- Page 78 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
When he had given it up, he surrendered unconditionally to the
cough, but was presently anxious to transmit, through its
subsidence, an idea that he found it impossible to shake across the
table between us out of an inarticulate forefinger end. It assumed
form in time. Why not ask the lady herself? We demurred, and the old
soldier explained.</p>

<p>"Not rushin' at her, you know, and sayin', 'Who the dooce was it
married you, ma'am?' I'm not a dam fool. Showin' tact, you
know&mdash;puttin' it easy and accidental. 'Who was that young beggar
now?&mdash;inspector&mdash;surveyor&mdash;something of the sort&mdash;up at Umballa in
seventy-nine? Burrumpooter Irrigation&mdash;that's what <i>he</i> was on.'
And, Lard bless you, my dear sir, you don't suppose she'll up and
say, 'I suppose you mean that dam husband of mine.' Not she!
Sensible woman that, sir&mdash;seen the world&mdash;knows a thing or two.
You'll see she'll only say, 'That was Foodle or Parker or Stebbins
or Jephson,' as may be, accordin' to the name."</p>

<p>We did not see our way to this enterprise, and said so. We drew a
line; said there were things you could do, and things you couldn't
do. The Major chuckled, and admitted this might be so; his old
governor used to say, "Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique
fines." The last two words remained behind in the cough, unless,
indeed, they were shaken out off the Major's forefinger into a
squeezed lemon that was awaiting its Seltzer.</p>

<p>"But I can tell you thing, Mr.," said he, forgetting our name, as
soon as he felt soothed by the lemon-squash. "He didn't keep his
name, that young man didn't. You may bet he didn't safely! Only,
it's no use askin' me why, nor what he changed it to. If it <i>was</i>
him that was lost in the Bush in New South Wales, when I was at
Sydney, why, of course that chap's <i>name</i> was the same. I remember
that much. Can't get hold of the name, though." He appeared to
consult the pattern on his silk pocket-handkerchief as an oracle,
and to await its answer with a thoughtful eye. Presently he blew his
nose on the oracle, and returned it to his pocket, adding: "But it's
a speculation&mdash;little speculation of my own. Don't <i>ask me</i>!" We
saw, however, that more would come, without asking. And it came.</p>

<p>"It made a talk out there at the time. But <i>that</i> didn't bring him
to life. You may talk till you're hoarse, but you won't bring

<!-- Page 79 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
a
dead man to&mdash;not when he's twenty miles off in a forest of
gum-trees, as like as tallow-candles.... Oh yes, they had the
natives put on the scent&mdash;black trackers, they call 'em&mdash;but, Lard!
it was all no use. They only followed the scent of his horse, and
the horse came back a fortnight after with them on his heels, an
hour or so behind.... He'd only just left his party a moment, and
meant to come back into the open. I suppose he thought he was sure
to cross a cutting, and got trapped in the solid woodland."</p>

<p>"But what was the speculation? You said just now...."</p>

<p>"Not much to go by," said the Major, shaking a discouraging head.
"Another joker with another name, who turned up a hundred miles off!
Harrisson, I fancy&mdash;yes, Harrisson. It was only my idea they were
the same. I came away, and don't know how they settled it."</p>

<p>"But something, Major Roper, must have made you think this man the
same&mdash;the same as Jeremiah Indermaur, or whatever his name was&mdash;Mrs.
Nightingale's man?"</p>

<p>"Somethin' must! What it was is another pair of shoes." He cogitated
and reflected, but seemed to get no nearer. "You ask Pelloo," he
said. "He might give you a tip." Then he called for a small glass of
cognac, because the Seltzer was such dam chilly stuff, and the dry
sherry was no use at all. We left him arranging the oracle over his
face, with a view to a serious nap.</p>

<p>We got a few words shortly after with General Pellew, who seemed a
little surprised at the Major's having referred to him for
information.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said he, "why our friend Roper shouldn't recollect
as much about it as I do. However, I do certainly remember that when
this young gentleman, whatever his name was, left the station, he
did go to Sydney or Melbourne, and I have some hazy recollection of
some one saying that he was lost in the Bush. But why old Jack
fancies he was found again or changed his name to Harrisson I
haven't the slightest idea."</p>

<p>So that all we ourselves succeeded in getting at about Gerry may be
said to have been the trap-door he vanished through. Whether Mrs.
Nightingale got at other sources of information we cannot

<!-- Page 80 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
say.
Whatever she learned she would be sure to keep her own counsel
about. She may have concluded that the bones of the husband who had
in a fit of anger deserted her had been picked by white ants, twenty
years ago, in an Australian forest; or she may have come to know, by
some means, of his resuscitation from the Bush, and his successes or
failures in a later life elsewhere. We have had our own reasons for
doubting that she ever knew that he took the name of Harrisson&mdash;if
he really did&mdash;a point which seemed to us very uncertain, so far as
the Major's narrative went. If she did get a scrap of tidings, a
flying word, about him now and again, it was most likely all she
got. And when she got it she would feel the danger of further
inquiry&mdash;the difficulty of laying the reasons for her curiosity
before her informant. You can't easily say to a stranger: "Oh, do
tell us about Mrs.&nbsp;Jones or Mr.&nbsp;Smith. She or he is our divorced or
separated wife or husband." A German might, but Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale was
not a German.</p>

<p>However, she <i>may</i> have heard something about that Gerry, we grant
you, in all those twenty long years. But if you ask us our
opinion&mdash;our private opinion&mdash;it is that she scarcely heard of him,
if she heard at all, and certainly never set eyes on him, until one
day her madcap little daughter brought him home, half-killed by an
electric shock, in a cab we were at some pains to describe
accurately a few pages ago. And even then, had it not been for the
individualities of that cab, she might have missed seeing him, and
let him go away to the infirmary or the police-station, and probably
never been near him again.</p>

<p>As it was, the face she saw when a freak of chance led to her
following that cab, and looking in out of mere curiosity at its
occupant, was the face of her old lover&mdash;of her husband.
Eighteen&mdash;twenty&mdash;years had made a man of one who was then little
more than a boy. The mark of the world he had lived in was on him;
and it was the mark of a rough, strong world where one fights, and,
if one is a man of this sort, maybe wins. But she never doubted his
identity for a moment. And the way in which she grasped the
situation&mdash;above all, the fact that he had not recognised her and
would not recognise her&mdash;quite justified, to our thinking, Major
Roper's opinion of her powers of self-command.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these were not so absolute that her demeanour escaped
comment from the cabby, the only witness of her first sight of the
"electrocuted" man. He spoke of her afterwards as that squealing
party down that sanguinary little turning off Shepherd's Bush Road
he took that sanguinary galvanic shock to.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="subhead">HOW THOSE GIRLS DO CHATTER OVER THEIR MUSIC! MRS. NIGHTINGALE'S
RESOLUTION. BUT, THE RISK! A HARD PART TO PLAY. THERE WAS ONLY MAMMA
FOR THE GIRL! THE GARDEN OF LONG&nbsp;AGO</p>

<p>Two parts in a sestet, played alone, may be a maddening torture to a
person whose musical imagination is not equal to supplying the other
four. Perhaps you have heard Haydn, Op.&nbsp;1704, and rejoiced in the
logical consecutiveness of its fugues, the indisputableness of its
well-classified statements, the swift pertinence of the repartees of
the first violin to the second, the apt <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> and orderly
reorganization of their epigrammatic interchanges by the 'cello and
the double-bass, the steady typewritten report and summary of the
whole by the pianoforte, and the regretful exception to so many
points taken by the clarionet. If so, you have no doubt felt, as we
have, a sense of perfect satisfaction at faultless musical
structure, without having to surrender your soul unconditionally to
the passionate appeal of a Beethoven, or to split your musical
brains in conjectures about what Volkanikoffsky is driving at. You
will find at the end that you have passed an hour or so of tranquil
enjoyment, and are mighty content with yourself, the performers, and
every one else.</p>

<p>But if you only hear the two parts, played alone, and your mental
image of all the other parts is not strong enough to prevent your
hearing the two performers count the bars while the non-performers
don't do anything at all, you will probably go away and come back
presently, or go mad.</p>

<p>Nobody else was there when Sally and L&aelig;titia Wilson were counting
four, and beginning too soon, and having to go back and begin all
over again, and missing a bar, and knocking down their music-stands
when they had to turn over quick. So nobody went mad. Mamma had gone
to an anti-vaccination meeting, and Athene had gone to stay over
Bank Holiday at Leighton Buzzard, and the boys had gone to skate,
and papa was in his study

<!-- Page 83 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and didn't matter, and they had the
drawing-room to themselves. Oh dear, how very often they did count
four, to be sure!</p>

<p>Sally was <i>distraite</i>, and wasn't paying proper attention to the
music. Whenever a string had to be tightened by either, Sally
introduced foreign matter. L&aelig;titia was firm and stern (she was
twenty-four, if you please!), and wouldn't respond. As thus, in a
tightening-up pause:</p>

<p>"I like him awfully, you know, Tishy. In fact, I love him. It's a
pleasure to hear him come into the house. Only&mdash;one's <i>mother</i>, you
know! It's the <i>oddity</i> of it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. <i>Now</i>, are you ready?... It only clickets down because
you will <i>not</i> screw in; it's no use turning and leaving the key
sloppy...."</p>

<p>"I know, Tishy dear&mdash;teach your granny! There, I think that's right
now. But it <i>is</i> funny when it's one's mother, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four! There&mdash;you didn't begin! Remember, you've
got to begin on the demisemiquaver at the end of the bar&mdash;only not
too staccato, remember&mdash;and allow for the pause. Now&mdash;one, two,
three, four, and you begin&mdash;in the <i>middle</i> of four&mdash;<i>not</i> the end.
Oh dear! Now once more...." etc.</p>

<p>You will at once see from this that Sally had lost no time in
finding a confidante for the fossil's communication.</p>

<p>An hour and a half of resolute practising makes you not at all sorry
for an oasis in the counting, which you inaugurate (or whatever you
do when it's an oasis) by smashing the top coal and making a great
blaze. And then you go ever so close, and can talk.</p>

<p>"Are you sure it isn't Colonel Lund's mistake? Old gentlemen get
very fanciful." Thus Miss Wilson. But it seems Sally hasn't much
doubt. Rather the other way round, if anything!</p>

<p>"I thought it might be, all the way to Norland Square. Then I
changed my mind coming up the hill. Of course, I don't know about
mamma till I ask her. But I expect the Major's right about Mr.
Fenwick."</p>

<p>"But how does <i>he</i> know? How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." Sally tastes the points of a holly-leaf with her

<!-- Page 84 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
tongue-tip, discreetly, to see how sharp they are, and cogitates.
"At least," she continues, "I <i>do</i> know. He never takes his eyes off
mamma from the minute he comes into the house."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Besides&mdash;lots of things! Oh no; as far as that goes, I should say
<i>he</i> was spooney."</p>

<p>"I see. You're a vulgar child, all the same! But about your
mother&mdash;that's the point."</p>

<p>The vulgar child cogitates still more gravely.</p>

<p>"I should say <i>now</i>," she says, after thinking it over, "that&mdash;only
I never noticed it at the time, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That what?"</p>

<p>"That mamma knows Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick is spooney, and looks up at times to
see that he's going on."</p>

<p>L&aelig;titia seems to receive this idea with some hesitation or reserve.
"Looks up at times to see if he's going on?" she repeats
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course&mdash;like we should. Only I didn't say 'see if.' I said
'see that.' It makes all the difference."</p>

<p>Miss Wilson breaks into a laugh. "And there you are all the time
looking as if butter wouldn't melt in your mouth, and as grave as a
judge."</p>

<p>Sally has to acquiesce in being kissed by her friend at this point;
but she curls up a little as one who protests against being
patronised. "We-e-e-ell!" she says, lengthening out the word, "why
not? I don't see anything in <i>that</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh no, dear&mdash;<i>that's</i> all right! Why shouldn't it be?"</p>

<p>But this isn't candid of L&aelig;titia, whose speech and kiss had
certainly appeared to impute suppressed insight, or penetration, or
sly-pussness, or something of that sort to her young friend. But
with an implied claim to rights of insight, on her own account, from
seniority. Sally is <i>froiss&eacute;e</i> at this, but not beyond jerking the
topic into a new light.</p>

<p>"Of course, it's their being grown up that makes one stare so. If it
wasn't for that...." But this gives away her case, surrenders all
claim to her equality with L&aelig;titia's twenty-four years. The
advantage is caught at meanly.</p>

<p>"That's only because you're a baby, dear. Wait till you're ten

<!-- Page 85 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
years older, and thirty-eight won't seem so old. I suppose your
mother's about that?"</p>

<p>"Mother? Why, she's nearly thirty-nine!"</p>

<p>"And Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>he's</i> forty-one. <i>Quite!</i> Because we talked it all over, and
made out they were over eighty between them."</p>

<p>"Who talked it over?"</p>

<p>"Why, him and her and me, of course. Last night."</p>

<p>"Who did you have, Sally dear?"</p>

<p>"Only ourselves, and Dr.&nbsp;Prosy and his Goody mother."</p>

<p>"I thought Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I counted him in with us&mdash;mother and me and the Major."</p>

<p>"Oh, you counted him in?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I count him in, if I like?"</p>

<p>"Why not? And you do like?" There is an appearance of irritating
sagacity about Sally's friend. "What did Dr.&nbsp;Vereker say, Sally
dear?"</p>

<p>"Doc-tor Vereker! Dr.&nbsp;Prosy. Prosy's not a referee&mdash;it was no
concern of his! Besides&mdash;they'd gone."</p>

<p>"Who'd gone?"</p>

<p>"Dr.&nbsp;Prosy and his old hen of a mother. Well, Tishy dear, she <i>is</i>
like that. Comes wobbling down on you as if you were a chicken! I
hope you don't think mother and I and Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick would talk about
how old we were added together, with old Goody Prosy in it!"</p>

<p>"Of course not, dear!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tishy dear, how aggravating you are! Now do please don't be
penetrating. You know you're trying to get at something; and there's
nothing to get at. It was perfectly natural. Only, of course, we
should never dream of talking about how old before people and their
gossipy old mothers."</p>

<p>"Of course not, dear!"</p>

<p>"There, now! You're being imperturbable! I knew you would. But you
may say what you like&mdash;there really was nothing in it. Nothing
whatever that time! However, of course mother does like Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick
very much&mdash;everybody knows that."</p>

<p>L&aelig;titia says time will show, and Sally says, "Show what?" For the
remark connects with nothing in the conversation. Its maker

<!-- Page 86 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
does
not reply, but retires into the fastnesses of a higher philosophy,
unknown to the teens, but somehow attainable in the early twenties.
She comes down, however, to ask after Dr.&nbsp;Vereker. Sally has as good
as held her tongue about him. Have they quarrelled?</p>

<p>"My dear Tishy! The idea! A <i>perfect stranger</i>!"</p>

<p>"I thought you were such good friends."</p>

<p>"I've nothing against Dr.&nbsp;Vereker. But fancy quarrelling with him!
Like bosom friends. Kissing and making it up. What next!" L&aelig;titia
seems to have discovered that Sally, subjected to a fixed amused
look, is sure to develop, and maintains one; and Sally follows on:</p>

<p>"One has to be on an intimate footing to fall out. Besides, people
shouldn't be hen's sons. Not if they expect that sort of thing!"</p>

<p>"Which sort?"</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well, Tishy dear! And they shouldn't be worthy,
either, people shouldn't. I'm not at all sure it isn't his
worthiness, just as much as his mother. I <i>could</i> swallow his
mother, if it came to that!"</p>

<p>L&aelig;titia, without relaxing the magnetism of her look, is replacing a
defective string. But a stimulating word will keep Sally up to the
mark. It would be a pity she should die down, having got so far.</p>

<p>"Not at all sure <i>what</i> isn't his worthiness!"</p>

<p>"Now, Tishy dear, what nonsense! As if you didn't understand! You
may just as well be penetrating outright, if you're going to go on
like that. All I know is that, worthiness or no, if Dr.&nbsp;Vereker
expects I'm going to put him on a quarrelling footing, he's
mistaken, and the sooner he gives up the idea the better. I suppose
he'll be wanting me to cherish him next."</p>

<p>And then what does that irritating L&aelig;titia Wilson do but say
suddenly, "I'm quite ready for the scherzo, dear, if you are." Just
as if Sally had been talking all this for her own private
satisfaction and amusement! And she knew perfectly well, L&aelig;titia
did, that she had been eliciting, and that she meant to wait a day
or two, and begin again ever so far on, and make believe Sally had
said heaps of things. And Sally had really said nothing&mdash;<i>nothing</i>!</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 87 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
</div>

<p>However, Miss Wilson was certainly a very fine violin figure, and
really striking in long sostenuto notes, with a fine throat and
handsome fingers on her left hand with broad bones, and a handsome
wrist on her bowing-arm where it was wanted. Only now, of course,
she hadn't got her Egyptian bracelet that looked so well, and her
hair wasn't done in a coronet, but only just twisted up anyhow.
Besides, when it's a difficult scherzo and you take it quick, your
appearance of having the concentration of Bonaparte and Julius
C&aelig;sar, and the alacrity of a wild cat, doesn't bring out your good
points. Give us an <i>andante maestoso</i> movement, or a <i>diminuendo
rallentando</i> that reaches the very climax and acme of slowness
itself just before the applause comes! It was rather as a meditation
in contrasts, though, that Sally thought thus to herself; for
detached musical jerks of diabolical rapidity, that have to be
snapped at with the punctuality of the mosquito slayer, don't show
your rounded lines to advantage, and make you clench your teeth and
glare horribly.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Our story is like the scherzo in one respect: it has to be given in
detached jerks&mdash;literary, not musical&mdash;and these jerks don't come at
any stated intervals at all. The music was bad enough&mdash;so Sally and
L&aelig;titia thought&mdash;but the chronicle is more spasmodic still. However,
if you want to know its remaining particulars, you will have to
brace yourself up to tolerating an intermittent style. It is the
only one our means of collecting information admits of.</p>

<p>This little musical interlude, and the accidental chat of our two
young performers, gives us a kind of idea of what was the position
of things at Krakatoa Villa six months after Fenwick made his
singular reappearance in the life of Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale. We shall rely
on your drawing all our inferences. There is only one belief of ours
we need to lay stress upon; it is that the lady's scheme to do all
she could to recapture and hold this man who had been her husband
was no mere slow suggestion of the course of events in that six
months, but a swift and decisive resolution&mdash;one that, if not
absolutely made at once, paused only in the making until she was
quite satisfied that the disappearance of Fenwick's past was an
accomplished fact. Once satisfied of that, he became to her simply
the man she had loved twenty years ago&mdash;the

<!-- Page 88 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
man who did not, could
not, forgive her what seemed so atrocious a wrong, but whom she
could forgive the unforgiveness of; and this all the more if she had
come to know of the ruinous effect her betrayal of him had had&mdash;must
have had&mdash;upon his after-life. He was this man&mdash;this very man&mdash;to
all appearance with a mysterious veil drawn, perhaps for ever, over
the terrible close of their brief linked life and its hideous
cause&mdash;over all that she would have asked and prayed should be
forgotten. If only this oblivion could be maintained!&mdash;that was her
fear. If it could, what task could be sweeter to her than to make
him such amends as lay in her power for the wrong she had done
him&mdash;how faultfully, who shall say? And if, in late old age, no dawn
of memory having gleamed in his ruined mind, she came to be able to
speak to him and tell him his own story&mdash;the tale of the wreck of
his early years&mdash;would not that almost, <i>almost</i>, carry with it a
kind of compensation for what she had undergone?</p>

<p>But her terror of seeing a return of memory now was a haunting
nightmare to her. She could only soothe and alleviate her anxiety by
suggesting efforts at recollection to Fenwick, and observing with
concealed satisfaction how utterly useless they all were. She felt
guilty at heart in being so happy at his ill-success, and had to
practise an excusable hypocrisy, an affectation of disappointment at
his repeated failures. On one particular occasion a shudder of
apprehension passed through her; she thought he had got a clue. If
he did, what was to prevent his following it up? She found it hard
to say to him how sorry she was this clue led to nothing, and to
forecast from it encouragement for the future. But she said to
herself after that, that she was a good actress, and had played her
part well. The part was a hard one.</p>

<p>For what came about was this. It chanced one evening, some three
months after the railway adventure, when Fenwick had become an
accepted and constant visitor at Krakatoa Villa, that as he took a
very late leave of Sally and her mother, the latter came out with
him into the always quiet road, while Sally ran back into the house
to direct a letter he was to post, but which had been forgotten for
the moment, just as he was departing.</p>

<p>They had talked a great deal, and with a closer familiarity than

<!-- Page 89 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
ever before, of the problem of Fenwick's oblivion. Both ladies had
gone on the lines of suggesting clues, trying to recall to him the
things that <i>must</i> have been in his life as in others. How about his
parents? Well, he remembered that, as a fact, he had a father and
mother. It was <i>themselves</i> he could not recollect. How about his
schooldays? No, that was a blank. He could not even remember having
been flogged. Yet the idea of school was not unfamiliar; how,
otherwise, could he laugh as he did at the absurdity of forgetting
all about it, especially being flogged? But his brothers, his
sisters, how <i>could</i> he forget <i>them</i>? He <i>did</i>, although in their
case, as in that of his parents, he somehow knew that some definite
identities had existed that he had forgotten. But any effort to
recall any specific person came to nothing, or else he only
succeeded in reviving images manifestly confused with characters in
fiction or history. Then Sally, who was rather incredulous about
this complete vacuity of mind, had said to him: "But come now, Mr.
Fenwick, you don't mean to say you don't know if you ever had a
sweetheart?" And he had replied with a laugh: "My dear Miss Sally,
I'm sure I must have had plenty of sweethearts. Perhaps it's because
I had so many that I have forgotten them all&mdash;all&mdash;all! They are all
gone with the rest. I can do sums, and can speak French, but what
school I learned to keep accounts at I can't tell you; and as to
where I lived (as I must have done) among French people to speak
French, I can tell no more than Adam." And then he had become rather
reserved and silent till he got up to go, and they had not liked to
press him for more. The pained look they had often been distressed
to see came on his face, and he pressed his fingers on his eyelids
as though shutting out the present world might help him to recall
the past; then with a rough head-shake of his thick hair, like a big
dog, and a brushing of it about with both hands, as though he would
rouse this useless head of his to some sort of action, he put the
whole thing aside, and talked of other matters till he left the
house.</p>

<p>But when he and Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale found themselves alone in the road,
enjoying the delicious west wind that meant before the morning to
become an equinoctial gale, and blow down chimney-pots and sink
ships, he turned to her and went back to what they had been talking
of. She could see the fine strong markings of his face

<!-- Page 90 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
in the
moonlight, the great jaw and firm lips, the handsome nose damaged by
a scar that lay true across the bridge of it, and looked white in
the gleam of the moon, the sad large eyelids and the grave eyes that
had retaken the look he had shaken off. She could note and measure
every change maturity had stamped upon him, and could see behind it
the boy that had come to meet her at the station at Umballa twenty
years before&mdash;had met her full of hope, met her to claim his reward
after the long delay through the hideous days of the pestilence, to
inaugurate the anticipated hours of happiness he had trembled to
dream of. And the worst of the cholera wards that had filled the
last months of his life with horror had held nothing for him so bad
as the tale she had to tell or conceal. She could see back upon it
as they stood there in the moonlight. Do not say she was not a
strong woman.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale," Fenwick said, "it's always a night
of this sort that brings back one's youth? You know what I mean?"</p>

<p>"I think I understand what you mean, Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick. You mean if"&mdash;she
hesitated a moment&mdash;"if you <i>could</i> recollect."</p>

<p>He nodded a complete yes.</p>

<p>"Just that," said he. "I don't know if it's the millions of dry
leaves sweeping about, or the moon scudding so quick through the
clouds, or the smell of the Atlantic, or the bark coming off the
plane-trees, or the wind blowing the roads into smooth dust-drifts
and hard clear-ups you could eat your dinner off&mdash;I don't know what
it is, but something or another on a night of this sort does always
seem to bring old times back, when, as you say, they can be got back
on any terms." He half-laughed, not in earnest. She found something
to say, also not very much in earnest.</p>

<p>"Because we remember nights of the sort when we were small, and that
brings them back."</p>

<p>"Come, I say now, Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale! As if we couldn't remember all
sorts of nights, and nothing comes back about them. It's this
particular sort of night does the job."</p>

<p>"Did you think you remembered something, Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick?" There was
anxiety in her voice, but no need to conceal it. It would as readily
pass muster for anxiety that he <i>should</i> have remembered something
as that he shouldn't.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 91 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"I can hardly go so far as that. But that joke of your little
pussycat about the sweethearts got mixed with the smell of the wind
and the chrysanthemums and dahlias and sunflowers." He pressed his
fingers hard on his eyes again. "Do you know, there's pain in
it&mdash;worse than you'd think! The half-idea that comes is not painful
in itself&mdash;rather the contrary&mdash;but it gives my brain a twist at the
point at which I can recall no more. Yes, it's painful!"</p>

<p>"But there <i>was</i> a half-idea? Forgive me if it gives you pain, and
don't try. Only I'm not sure you ought not to try when the chance
comes, for your own sake."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind trying. This time it was something about a front
garden and a girl and a dog-cart." He had not taken his hands from
his eyes. Now he did so, brushing them on his hair and forehead as
before. "I get no nearer," said he.</p>

<p>"A front garden and a girl and a dog-cart," thus Miss Sally saucily,
coming out with the letter. "Did you have a very touching parting,
Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick? Now, mind you don't forget to post it. I wouldn't trust
you!" He took the letter from her, but seemed too <i>distrait</i> to
notice her little piece of levity; then, still speaking as if in
distress or pain, he said:</p>

<p>"It must have been some front garden, long ago. This one brought it
back&mdash;this and the leaves. Only there was nothing for the dog-cart."</p>

<p>"And only mamma for the girl"&mdash;thus Sally the irrepressible. And
then mamma laughed, but not Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick at all. Only Sally thought
her mother's laugh came hard, and said to herself, now she should
catch it for chaffing! However, she didn't catch it, although the
abruptness with which her mother said good-night and went back into
the house half confirmed her impression that she should.</p>

<p>On the contrary, when she followed her a few minutes later, having
accompanied Fenwick to near the road end, and scampered back to the
house, turning to throw Parthian good-nights after him, she found
her mother pale and thoughtful, and surely the lips and hands she
used to kiss her with were cold. She wasn't even sure that wasn't a
tear. Perhaps it was.</p>

<p>For mamma had had a bad ten minutes&mdash;scarcely a <i>mauvais quart
d'heure</i>&mdash;and even that short interim had given her time to

<!-- Page 92 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
see
that this kind of thing would be incessant with her recovered
husband, granting that she could recover him. Only of that she felt
nearly secure&mdash;unaccountably, perhaps; certainly not warrantably.
But how to bear this kind of thing through a life?&mdash;that was the
question.</p>

<p>What was this kind of thing, this bad ten minutes, that had made her
tremble, and turn white, and glad to get away, and be alone a minute
before Sally came up jubilant? But oh, how glad, for all that, to
get at her daughter's lips to kiss!&mdash;only not too hard, so as to
suggest reflection and analysis.</p>

<p>What had upset Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale was a counter-memory of twenty years
ago, a clear and full and vivid recollection of the garden and the
girl and the dog-cart. And then also there "had only been mamma for
the girl." But oh, the relation the lassie who said those words bore
to those past days, her place in the drama that filled them out!
Little wonder her mother's brain reeled.</p>

<p>She could see it all vividly now, all over again. A glorious night
like this; a dazzling full moon sailing in the blue beyond the
tumbled chaos of loose cloud so near the earth; the riot of the
wind-swept trees fighting to keep a shred of their old green on
their bareness, making new concessions to the blast, and beating
their stripped limbs together in their despair; the endless swirl of
leaves at liberty, free now at last to enjoy a short and merry life
before becoming food for worms. She could see the face she had just
parted from, but twenty years younger&mdash;the same bone-structure with
its unscarred youth upon it, only a lesser beard with a sunnier
tinge, but all the thickness of the hair. She could remember the
voices in the house, the farewells to the young man who was just
starting for India, and how she slipped down to say a last good-bye
on her own account, and felt grateful to that old Dean Ireson (the
only time in her life) for begging her mother (who, of course, was
the Rosalind Nightingale Fenwick spoke of in the train) on no
account to expose herself to the night-air. Why, she might have come
down, too, into the garden, and spoiled it all! And then she could
remember&mdash;oh, how well!&mdash;their last words in the windy garden, and
the horse in the dog-cart, fresh from his stall, and officiously
anxious to catch the train&mdash;as good as saying so, with flings and
stamps. And

<!-- Page 93 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
how little she cared if the groom <i>did</i> hear him call
her Rosey, for that was his name for her.</p>

<p>"Now, Gerry, remember, I've made you <i>no</i> promises; but I'll play
fair. If I change my mind, I'll write and tell you. And you may
write to me."</p>

<p>"Every day?"</p>

<p>"Silly boy, be reasonable! Once a month! You'll see, you'll get
tired of it."</p>

<p>"Come, Rosey, I say! The idea!"</p>

<p>"Yes, you will! Now go! You'll lose the train."</p>

<p>"Oh, Rosey dearest!"</p>

<p>"Yes, what?&mdash;you'll lose the train."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dearest, I <i>can't</i>! Just think&mdash;I may never see you again!"</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> go, Gerry dear! And there's that blockhead of a boy
outside there."</p>

<p>"Never mind him; he's nobody! Only one more.... Yes, <i>dearest love</i>,
I'm really going.... Good-bye! good-bye! God bless you!"</p>

<p>And then how she stood there with the memory of his lips dying on
hers, alone by the gate, in the wild wind, and heard the sharp
regular trot of the horse lessen on the hard road and die away, and
then the running of a train she thought was his, and how he would
surely miss it, and have to come back. And it <i>would</i> be nice just
to see him again! But he was gone, for all that, and he was a dear
good boy. And she recollected going to her bedroom to do up her
hair, which had all come down, and hiding her face on her pillow in
a big burst of tears.</p>

<p>Her mind harked back on all this as he himself, the same but
changed, stood there in the moonlight striving to recollect it all,
and mysteriously failing. But at least, he <i>did</i> fail, and that was
something. But oh, what a wrench it gave to life, thought, reason,
to all her heart and being, to have that unconscious chit cut in
with "only mamma for the girl!" What and whence was this little
malaprop? Her overwrought mind shut away this question&mdash;almost in
the asking it&mdash;with "Dearer to me, at least, than anything else in
this world, unless&mdash;&mdash;" and then shut away the rest of the answer.</p>

<p>But she was glad to get at Sally, and feel her there, though she

<!-- Page 94 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
could not speak freely to her&mdash;nor, indeed, speak at all. And as
soon as the tension died down, she went back as to a source of peace
to the failure of his powers of memory, obvious, complete. All her
hopes lay in that. Where would they be if the whole past were
suddenly sprung on him? He <i>might</i> be ready to bury bygones, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She woke next day fairly at ease in her mind, but feeling as one
does after any near-run escape. And then it was she said to herself
that she was a good actress. But the part <i>was</i> hard to act.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>The relations between Fenwick and the Nightingales, mother and
daughter, seem to us to have been acquiring cohesion at the time of
the foregoing interview. It is rather difficult to say why. But it
serves to pave the way to the state of things that Sally accepted as
the "spooneyness" of Fenwick, and her mother's observation of his
"going on," without the dimmest idea of the underlying motives of
the drama. Another three months, bringing us on to these
discriminations of Sally's, may also have brought about appearances
that justified them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="subhead">THE DANGERS OF AN UNKNOWN PAST. NETTLE-GRASPING, AND A RECURRENCE.
WHO AMONG US COURTS CATECHISM ABOUT HIMSELF? A UNIVERSALLY PROVIDED
YOUNG MAN. HOW ABOUT THE POOR OLD FURNITURE?</p>

<p>We defy the acutest of psychologists to estimate precisely the hold
love has on a man who is diagnosed, in the language of the vulgar
child Sally, as "spooney." Probably no patient has ever succeeded in
doing this himself. It is quite another matter when the eruption has
broken out, when the crater is vomiting flames and the lava is
pouring down on the little homesteads at the mountain's base, that
may stand in the metaphor for all that man's duties and obligations.
By that time he <i>knows</i>. But, while still within the "spooney" zone
he knows no more than you or I (or that most important <i>she</i>) what
the morrow means to bring. Will it be a step on or a step back? An
altogether new <i>she</i>, or the fires of the volcano, let loose beyond
recall?</p>

<p>Fenwick was certainly not in a position to gauge his own feelings
towards Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale. All previous experience was cut away from
him, or seemed so. He might have been, for anything he knew, a
married man with a family, a devoted husband. He might have been
recently wedded to an adoring bride, and she might now be
heart-broken in her loneliness. How could he tell? The only thing
that gave him courage about this was that he <i>could</i> remember the
fact that he had had parents, brothers, sisters. He could not
recollect <i>anything whatever</i> about sweetheart, wife, or child.
Unearthly gusts of half-ideas came to him at times, like that of the
girl and the dog-cart. But they only gave him pain, and went away
unsolved, leaving him sick and dizzy.</p>

<p>His situation was an acutely distressing one. He was shackled and
embarrassed, so to speak, by what he knew of his relations to
existence. At any moment a past might be sprung on him, bringing

<!-- Page 96 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
him suddenly face to face with God knows what. So strongly did he
feel this that he often said to himself that the greatest boon that
could be granted to him would be an assurance of continued oblivion.
He was especially afflicted by memories of an atrocious clearness
that would come to him in dreams, the horror of which would remain
on into his waking time. They were not necessarily horrible things
at all, but their clearness in the dream, and their total, if slow,
disappearance as the actual world came back, became sometimes an
excruciating torment. Who could say that they, or some equivalents,
might not reach him out of the past to-day or to-morrow&mdash;any time?</p>

<p>For instance, he had one morning waked up in a perfect agony&mdash;a cold
perspiration as of the worst nightmares&mdash;because of a dream harmless
enough in itself. He had suddenly remembered, in the dream-street he
could identify the houses of so plainly, a first-floor he had
occupied where he had left all his furniture locked up years ago.
And he had found the house and the first-floor quite easily, and had
not seen anything strange in the landlord saying that he and his old
woman often wondered when Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick would come for his things. It
was not the accumulation of rent unpaid, nor that of the dirt he
knew he should find on the furniture (all of which he could
recollect in the dream perfectly well), but the fact that he had
forgotten it all, and left it unclaimed all those years, that
excruciated him. Even his having to negotiate for its removal in his
shirt did not afflict him so much as his forgetfulness for so long
of the actual furniture; his conviction of the reality of which
lasted on after his discovery about his costume had made him
suspect, in his dream, that he was dreaming.</p>

<p>To a man whose memory is sound, who feels sure he looks back on an
actual past in security, such a dream is only a curiosity of sleep.
To Fenwick it was, like many others of the same sort, a possible
herald of an analogous revelation in waking hours, with a sequel of
dreadful verification from some abysm of an utterly forgotten past.</p>

<p>His worst terror, far and away, was the fear that he was married and
a father. It might have been supposed that this arose from a
provisional sense of pity for the wife and children he must have
left; that his mind would conceive hypothetical poverty for

<!-- Page 97 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
them,
or sorrow, disease, or death, the result direct or indirect of his
disappearance. But this was scarcely the case. They themselves were
too intensely hypothetical. In this respect the blank in his
intellect was so unqualified that it might never have occurred to
him to ask himself the question if they existed had it not been
suggested to him by Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale herself. It was, in fact, a
question she almost always recurred to when Miss Sally was out of
the way. It was no use trying to talk seriously when that little
monkey was there. She turned everything to a joke. But the Major was
quite another thing. He would back her up in anything reasonable.</p>

<p>"I wish more could be done to find out," said she for the twentieth
time to Fenwick one evening, shortly after the musical recital of
last chapter. "I don't feel as if it was right to give up
advertising. Suppose the poor thing is in Australia or America."</p>

<p>"The poor thing is my hypothetical wife?"</p>

<p>"Exactly so. Well, suppose she is. Some people never see any
newspapers at all. And all the while she may have been advertising
for <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh no; we should have been sure to see or hear."</p>

<p>"But why? Now I ask you, Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick, suppose she advertised half a
dozen times in the 'Melbourne Argus' or the 'New York Sun,' <i>would</i>
you have seen it, necessarily?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> should not, because I never see the 'Melbourne Argus' or the
'New York Sun.' But those agents we paid to look out go steadily
through the agony columns&mdash;the personal advertisements&mdash;of the whole
world's press; they would have found it if it had ever been
published."</p>

<p>"I dare say they only pocketed the money."</p>

<p>"That they did, no doubt. But they gave me something for it. A
hundred and twenty-three advertisements addressed to Fenwicks&mdash;none
of them to me!"</p>

<p>"But have we advertised enough?"</p>

<p>"Oh, heavens, yes. Think of the answers we've had! I've just
received the hundred and forty-second. From a lady in distressed
circumstances who bought a piano ten years ago from a party of my
name and initials&mdash;thought I might be inclined to buy it back at
half-price. She proposes to call on me early next week."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 98 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Poor Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick! It <i>is</i> discouraging, I admit. But, oh dear!
fancy if there's some poor thing breaking her heart somewhere! It's
easy enough for you&mdash;<i>you</i> don't believe in her."</p>

<p>"That's it; I don't!" He dropped a tone of pleasantry, and spoke
more seriously. "Dear Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale, if my absence of conviction
of the existence of this lady did not rise to the height of a
definite disbelief in her altogether&mdash;well, I should be wretched.
But I feel very strongly that I need not make myself a poor
miserable about her. I <i>don't</i> believe in her, that's the truth!"</p>

<p>"You don't believe a man could forget his wife?"</p>

<p>"I <i>can't</i> believe it, try how I may! Anything&mdash;anybody else&mdash;but
his wife, no!"</p>

<p>Fenwick had come in late in the evening, as he was in the habit of
doing, often three or four times in the week. He looked across from
his side of the hearthrug, where he had been standing watching the
fire, but could not see the face opposite to him. Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale
was sitting with her back to the light sheltering her eyes from the
blaze with a fire-screen. So Fenwick saw only the aureole the lamp
made in her hair&mdash;it was a fine halo with a golden tinge. Sally was
very proud of mamma's hair; it was much better fun to do than her
own, said the vulgar child. But even had she not been hidden by the
screen, the expression on her face might have meant nothing to
him&mdash;that is, nothing more than the ready sympathy he was so well
accustomed to. A little anxiety of eye, a tremor in the lip, the
birth of a frown without a sequel&mdash;these might have meant anything
or nothing. She might even have turned whiter than she did, and yet
not be said to show the cross-fire of torments in her heart. She
was, as we told you, a strong woman, either by nature, or else her
life had made her one.</p>

<p>For, think of what the recesses of her memory held; think of the
past she looked back on, and knew to be nothing but a blank to him.
Think of what <i>she</i> was, and <i>he</i> was, as he stood there and said,
"Anybody else, but his wife;" and then rather shaped the "No" that
followed with his lips than said it; but shook an emphasis into the
word with his head.</p>

<p>"When are you going to get your hair cut, Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick?" said she;
and he did think she changed the subject abruptly, without

<!-- Page 99 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
apparent
cause. "It's just like a lion's mane when you shake it like that."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, if you think it too disreputable."</p>

<p>"I like it. Sally wants to cut it...."</p>

<p>The last few words showed the completeness of Fenwick's <i>tame
cattitude</i> in the family. It had developed in an amazingly short
time. Was it due to the old attachment of this man and woman&mdash;an
attachment, mind you, that was sound and strong till it died a
violent death? We do not find this so very incredible; perhaps,
because that memory of their old parting in the garden went nearer
to an actual revival than any other stirring in his mind. But, of
course, there may have been others equally strong, only we chance to
hear of this one.</p>

<p>That was not our purpose, however, in recording such seeming trivial
chat. It was not trivial on Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale's part. She had made up
her mind to flinch from nothing, always to grasp her nettle. Here
was a nettle, and she seized it firmly. If she identified as clearly
as she did that shaken lion-mane of Fenwick's with that of Gerry,
the young man of twenty years ago, and seeing its identity was
silent, that would be flinching. She would and did say the self-same
thing she could recall saying to Gerry. And she asked Fenwick when
he was going to get his hair cut with a smile, that was like that of
the Indian brave under torture. A knife was through her heart. But
it was well done, so she thought to herself. If she could be as
intrepid as that, she could go on and live. She tried experiments of
this sort when the watchful merry eyes of her daughter were not upon
her, and even felt glad, this time, that the Major was having a doze
underneath a "Daily Telegraph." Fenwick took it all as a matter of
course, mere chaff....</p>

<p>Did he? If so, why, after a few words more of chat, did he press his
hands on his eyes and shake a puzzled head; then, after an abrupt
turn up and down the room, come back to where he stood at first and
draw a long breath?</p>

<p>"Was that a recurrence, Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick?" she asked. They had come to
speak of these mental discomforts as <i>recurrences</i>. They would
afflict him, not seldom, without bringing to his mind any definite
image. And this was the worst sort. When an image came, his mind
felt eased.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 100 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"A sort of one."</p>

<p>"Can you tell when it came on?" All this was nettle-grasping. She
was getting used to it. "Was it before or after I said that about
your hair?"</p>

<p>"After. No, before. Perhaps just about then." Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale
decided that she would not tempt Providence any further.
Self-discipline was good, but not carried to danger-point.</p>

<p>"Now sit down and be quiet," she said. "We won't talk any more about
unpleasant things. Only the worst of it is," she added, smiling,
"that one's topics&mdash;yours and mine, I mean&mdash;are so limited by the
conditions. I should ask any other man who had been about the world,
as you <i>must</i> have done, all sorts of questions about all sorts of
places&mdash;where he had been, whom he had seen. You can't answer
questions, though I hope you will some day...."</p>

<p>She paused, and he saw the reason. "You see," said he, with a
good-humoured laugh, "one gets back directly to the unpleasant
subject, whether one will or no. But if I could remember all about
my precious self, I might not court catechism about it...."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> should not about mine." This was said in a low tone, with a
silent look on the unraised eyes that was almost an invitation not
to hear, and her lips hardly moved to say it, either. He missed it
for the moment, but finished his speech with the thought in his
mind.</p>

<p>"Still, it's an ill-wind that blows nobody good. See what a clear
conscience I have! But what was that <i>you</i> said?"</p>

<p>She dropped the fire-screen and raised her eyes&mdash;fine eyes they
were, which we might have likened to those of Juno had the eyes of
oxen been blue&mdash;turning them full on him. "When?" said she.</p>

<p>"Just this minute. I ought to have apologized for interrupting you."</p>

<p>"I said I should not court catechism about myself. I should not."
Fenwick felt he could not assign this speech its proper place in the
dialogue without thinking. He thought gravely, looking to all
seeming into the fire for enlightenment; then turned round and
spoke.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Surely that is true, in a sense, of all mankind&mdash;mankind and
womankind. Nobody wants to be seen through. But one's past would
need to be a very shaky one to make one wish for an oblivion like
mine to extinguish it."</p>

<p>"I should not dislike it. I have now all that I wish to keep out of
the past. I have Sally. There is nothing I could not afford to
forget in the past, no one thing the loss of which could alter her
in the least, that little monkey of a daughter of mine! And there
are many, many things I should like to see the last of." From which
speech Fenwick derived an impression that the little monkey, the
vulgar child, had come back warm and living and welcome to the
speaker's mind, and had driven away some mists of night, some
uglinesses that hung about it. How he wished he could ask: "Was one
of them her father?" That was not practicable. But it was something
of that sort, clearly. His mind could not admit the idea of a
haunting remorse, a guilty conscience of an action of her own, in
the memory of the woman who spoke to him. He was too loyal to her
for that. Besides, the wording of her speech made no such
supposition necessary. Fenwick's answer to it fell back on
abstractions&mdash;the consolation a daughter must be, and so forth.</p>

<p>"There she is!" said her mother; and then added, as perturbation
without heralded Miss Sally's approach: "I will tell you what I
meant some other time." For there she was, no doubt of it, wild with
excitement to report the splendid success of the great sestet, the
production of which had been the event of the musical gathering she
had come from. And you know as well as we do how it is when youth
and high spirits burst in upon the sober stay-at-homes, intoxicated
with music and lights and supper and too many people talking at
once. Sally's eyebrows and teeth alone would have been enough to set
all the birds singing in the dullest coppices decorum ever planted,
let alone the tales she had to tell of all the strange and wonderful
things that had come to pass at the Erskine Peels', who were the
givers of the party, and always did things on such a scale.</p>

<p>"And where do you think, mother, Mrs.&nbsp;Erskine Peel gets all those
good-looking young men from that come to her parties? Why, from the
Stores, of course. Just fancy!... How do I know? Why, because I
talked to one of them for ever so long, and

<!-- Page 102 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
made him tell me all
about it. I detected him, and told him so straight off. How did I
recognise him? Why, of course, because he's that young man that came
here about the letter. Oh, <i>you</i> know, Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick! Gracious me, how
slow you are! The young man that brought you the letter to
translate. Rather tall, dark eyes."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, certainly. I remember him quite well. Well, I expect he
made a very good young man for a small tea-party."</p>

<p>"Of course he did, and it's quite ridiculous." By which the vulgar
child meant that class distinctions were ridiculous. She had this
way of rushing subjects, eliding the obvious, and relying on her
hearers. "He told me all about it. He'd been universally provided,
he said; and I promised not to tell. Miss Erskine Peel&mdash;that's
Orange, you know, the soprano&mdash;went to the manager and said her
mother said they <i>must</i> get more men, though it wasn't dancing, or
the rooms looked so bad; only they mustn't be fools, and must be
able to say Wagner and Liszt and things. And he hoped I didn't think
he was a fool."</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"Said I couldn't say&mdash;didn't know him well enough. He might be, to
look at. Or not, accordingly. I didn't say <i>that</i>, you know, mamma."</p>

<p>"I didn't know, darling. You're very rude sometimes."</p>

<p>"Well, he said he could certainly say Wagner and Liszt, and even
more, because&mdash;it was rather sad, you know, mamma dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sally, you've told that young man he may call; you know you have!"</p>

<p>"Well, mamma dear, and if I have, I don't see that anybody's mare's
dead. Because, do listen!" Fenwick interposed a parenthesis.</p>

<p>"I don't think you need to be apprehensive, Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale. He was
an educated young man enough. His not knowing a French phrase like
that implies nothing. Not one in a hundred would." The way in which
the Major, who, of course, had come out of his doze on the inrush of
Miss Sally, looked across at Fenwick as he said this, implied an
acquired faith in the judgment of the latter. Sally resumed.</p>

<p>"Just let me tell you. His name's Bradshaw. Only he's no relation

<!-- Page 103 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
to <i>the</i> Bradshaw&mdash;in a yellow cover, you know. We-e-ell, I don't
see anything in that!" Sally is defending her position against a
smile her mother and Fenwick have exchanged. They concede that there
is nothing in it, and Sally continues. "Where was I? Oh, Bradshaw;
yes. He was an awfully promising violinist&mdash;awfully promising! And
what do you think happened? Why, the nerves of his head gave way,
and he couldn't stand the vibration! So it came to being Cattley's
or nothing." Sally certainly had the faculty of cutting a long story
short.</p>

<p>She thought the story, so cut, one that her mother and Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick
might have shown a more active interest in, instead of saying it was
time for all of us to be in bed. She did not, however, ascribe to
them any external preoccupation&mdash;merely an abstract love of Truth;
for was it not nearly one o'clock in the morning?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a little incident of Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's departure, not
noticed at the moment, suddenly assumed vitality just as Sally was
"going off," and woke her up. What was it she overheard her mother
say to him, just as he was leaving the house, about something she
had promised to tell him some time? However, reflection on it with
waking faculties dissipated the importance it seemed to have
half-way to dreamland, and Sally went contentedly to sleep again.</p>

<p>Fenwick, as he walked to his lodgings through the dull February
night, did not regard this something, whatever it was, as a thing of
slight importance at all. He may have been only "spooney," but it
was in a sense that left him no pretence for thinking that anything
connected with this beautiful young widow-lady could be unimportant
to him. On the contrary, she was more and more filling all his
waking thoughts, and becoming the pivot on which all things turned.
It is true, he "dismissed from his mind"&mdash;whatever that means&mdash;every
presumptuous suggestion that in some precious time to come she might
be willing to throw in her lot with his own, and asked himself what
sort of thing was he that he should allow such an idea to come even
as far as contradiction-point? He, a poor inexplicable wreck! What
was the Self he had to offer, and what else had he? But, indeed, the
speculation rarely got even to this maturity, so promptly was it
nipped in the bud. Only, there were so

<!-- Page 104 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
many buds to nip. He became
aware that he was giving a good deal of attention to this sort of
gardening.</p>

<p>Also, he had a consciousness that he was growing morbidly anxious
for the maintenance of his own oblivion. That which was at first
only a misgiving about what a return of memory might bring to light,
was rapidly becoming a definite desire that nothing should come to
light at all. How <i>could</i> he look forward to that "hypothetical"
wife whom he did not in the least believe in, but who might be
somewhere, for all that! He knew perfectly well that his relations
with Krakatoa Villa would <i>not</i> remain the same, say what you might!
Of course, he also knew that he had no relations there that <i>need</i>
change&mdash;most certainly not! At this point an effort would be made
against the outcrop of his thoughts. Those confounded buds were
always bursting. It was impossible to be even with them.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was on this evening, or rather early morning, as he
walked home to his lodgings, that Fenwick began to recognise more
fully than he had done before Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale's share in what was,
if not an absolute repugnance to a revival of the unknown past, at
least a very ready acquiescence in his ignorance of it. But surely,
he reasoned with himself, if this cause is making me contented with
my darkness, it is the more reason that it should be penetrated.</p>

<p>An uncomfortable variation of his dream of the resurrected
first-floor crossed his mind. Suppose he had forgotten the
furniture, but remembered the place, and gone back to tenant it with
a van-load of new chairs and tables. What would he have done with
the poor old furniture?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="subhead">MORE GIRLS' CHATTER. SWEEPS AND DUSTMEN. HOW SALLY DISILLUSIONED
MR.&nbsp;BRADSHAW. OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN</p>

<p>It is impossible to make Gluck's music anything but a foretaste of
heaven, as long as there is any show of accuracy in the way it is
rendered. But, then, you must go straight on, and not go over a
difficult phrase until you know it. You must play fair. Orpheus
would probably only have provoked Cerberus&mdash;certainly wouldn't have
put him to sleep&mdash;if he had practised, and counted, and gone back
six bars and done it again.</p>

<p>But Cerberus wasn't at 260, Ladbroke Grove Road, on the Tuesday
following Mrs.&nbsp;Erskine Peel's musical party, which was the next time
Sally went to L&aelig;titia Wilson. And it was as well that he wasn't, for
Sally stuck in a passage at the end of one page and the beginning of
the next, so that you had to turn over in the middle; and it was bad
enough, goodness knew, without that! It might really have been the
north-west passage, so insuperable did it seem.</p>

<p>"I shall never get it right, I know, Tishy," said the viola.</p>

<p>And the violin replied: "Because you never pay any attention to the
arpeggio, dear. It doesn't begin on the chord. It begins on the G
flat. Look here, now. One&mdash;two&mdash;three. One&mdash;two&mdash;three."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's all very well. Who's going to turn over the leaf, I
should like to know? I know I shall never do it. Not because the
nerves of my head are giving way, but because I'm a duffer."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know what that young man is, dear?" Sally accepts
this quite contentedly, and immediately skips a great deal of
unnecessary conversation.</p>

<p>"I'm not in love with him, Tishy dear."</p>

<p>"Didn't say you were, dear. But I suppose you don't know what he is,
all the same." Which certainly seems inconsecutive, but we really
cannot be responsible for the way girls talk.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 106 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Don't know, and don't want to know. What is he?"</p>

<p>"He's from Cattley's." This throws a light on the conversation. It
shows that Sally had told L&aelig;titia who she was going to meet at her
mother's next evening. Sally is not surprised.</p>

<p>"As if I didn't know all about this! As if he didn't tell me his
story!"</p>

<p>"Like the mock-turtle in Alice?"</p>

<p>"Now, Tishy dear, is that an insinuation, or isn't it? Do be
candid!"</p>

<p>"The mock-turtle told his story. Once, he was a real turtle."</p>

<p>"Very well, Tishy dear. That's as much as to say Julius Bradshaw is
mock. I can't see where the mockness comes in myself. He told <i>me</i>
all about it, plain enough."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and you know what a rage Mrs.&nbsp;Erskine Peel is in, and says it
was an <i>&eacute;claircissement</i>."</p>

<p>"Why can't she be satisfied with English?... What! Of course, there
are <i>hundreds</i> of English equivalents for <i>&eacute;claircissement</i>. There's
bust-up."</p>

<p>"That's only one."</p>

<p>"Tishy dear, don't be aggravating! Keep to the point. Why mustn't I
have Julius Bradshaw to play with if I like because he's at
Cattley's?"</p>

<p>"You may, if you <i>like</i>, dear! As long as you're satisfied, it's all
right."</p>

<p>"What fault have you to find with him?"</p>

<p>"I! None at all. It's all perfectly right."</p>

<p>"You are <i>the</i> most irritating girl."</p>

<p>"Suppose we take the <i>adagio</i> now&mdash;if you're rested."</p>

<p>But Sally's back was up. "Not until you tell me what you really mean
about Julius Bradshaw."</p>

<p>So L&aelig;titia had her choice between an explicit statement of her
meaning, and an unsupported incursion into the <i>adagio</i>.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll admit there <i>are</i> such things as social
distinctions?"</p>

<p>Sally wouldn't admit anything whatever. If sociometry was to be a
science, it must be worked out without axioms or postulates. L&aelig;titia
immediately pointed out that if there were no such things as social
distinctions of course there was no reason why Mr.&nbsp;Julius Bradshaw
shouldn't take his violin to Krakatoa Villa.

<!-- Page 107 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
"Or here, or
anywhere," concluded L&aelig;titia, with a touch of pride in the status of
Ladbroke Grove Road. Whereupon Sally surrendered as much of her case
as she had left.</p>

<p>"You talk as if he was a sweep or a dustman," said she.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you should mind if I do, dear. Because, if there
are to be no social distinctions, there's no reason why all the
sweeps and dustmen in Christendom shouldn't come and play the violin
at Krakatoa Villa.... Now, not <i>too</i> slow, you know.
One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;that'll do." Perhaps Sally felt it would be a
feeble line of defence to dwell on the scarcity of good violinists
among sweeps and dustmen, and that was why she fell into rank
without comment.</p>

<p>This short conversation, some weeks on in the story, lets in one or
two gleams of side-light. It shows that Sally's permission to the
young man Bradshaw to call at her mother's had been promptly taken
advantage of&mdash;jumped at is the right expression. Also that Miss
Wilson had stuck-up ideas. Also that Sally was a disciple of what
used to be called Socialism; only really nowadays such a lot of
things get called Socialism that the word has lost all the
discriminative force one values so much in nouns substantive. Also
(only we knew it already) that Sally was no lawyer. We do not love
her the less, for our part.</p>

<p>But nothing in this interchange of shots between Sally and her
friend, nor in anything she said to her mother about Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw,
gives its due prominence to the fact that, though that young
gentleman was a devout worshipper at the shrine of St.&nbsp;Satisfax, he
had only become so on the Sunday after Miss Sally had casually
mentioned the latter as a saint she frequented. Perhaps she
"dismissed it from her mind," and it was obliging enough to go.
Perhaps she considered she had done her duty by it when she put on
record, in soliloquy, her opinion that if people chose to be gaping
idiots they might, and she couldn't help it. She had a happy faculty
for doing what she called putting young whippersnappers in their
proper places. This only meant that she managed to convey to them
that the lines they might elect to whippersnap on were not to be
those of sentimental nonsense. And perhaps she really dealt in the
wisest way with Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw's romantic adoration of her at a
distance when he fished for leave to call upon her. The line he made
his application

<!-- Page 108 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
on was that he should so like to play her a rapid
movement by an unpronounceable Slav. She said directly, why not come
and bring his violin on Wednesday evening at nine? That was her
mother's address on the card on the fiddle-case. He must recollect
it&mdash;which he did unequivocally.</p>

<p>Now, if this young lady had had a fan, she might have tittered with
it, or blushed slightly, and said, "Oh, Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw!" or, "Oh,
sir!" like in an old novel&mdash;one by Fanny Burney, or the like. But
she did nothing of the sort, and the consequence was that he had, as
it were, to change the <i>venue</i> of his adoration&mdash;to make it a little
less romantic, in fact. Her frank and breezy treatment of the
subject had let in a gust of fresh air, and blown away all
imagination. For there naturally was a good deal of that in a
passion based on a single interview and nourished by weekly
stimulants at morning services. In fact, when he presented himself
at Krakatoa Villa on Wednesday evening as invited&mdash;the day after
L&aelig;titia's remarks about his social position&mdash;he was quite prepared
to be introduced to the young woman's <i>fianc&eacute;</i>, if.... Only, when he
got as far as the <i>if</i>, he dropped the subject. As soon as he found
there was no such person he came to believe he would not have been
much disconcerted if there had been. How far this was true, who can
say?</p>

<p>He was personally one of those young men about whom you may easily
produce a false impression if you describe them at all. This is
because your reader will take the bit in his teeth, and run away
with an idea. If you say a nose has a bridge to it, this directly
produces in some minds an image like Blackfriars Bridge; that it is
straight, the &AElig;ginetan marbles; that it is <i>retrouss&eacute;</i>, the dog in
that Hogarth portrait. Suggest a cheerful countenance, and you stamp
your subject for ever as a Shakespearian clown. So you must be
content to know that Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw was a good-looking young man, of
dark complexion, and of rather over medium height and good manners.
If he had not been, he would never, as an article of universal
provision for parties, have passed muster at Cattley's. He was like
many other young men such as one sees in shops; but then, what very
nice-looking young men one sometimes sees there! Sally had classed
him as a young whippersnapper, but this was unjust, if it

<!-- Page 109 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
impugned
his stature. She repeated the disparaging epithet when, in further
justification to Miss Wilson of her asking him to her mother's
house, she sketched a policy of conduct to guide inexperienced girls
in their demeanour towards new male friends. "You let 'em come close
to, and have a good look," said the vulgar child. "Half of 'em will
be disgusted, and go away in a huff."</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale had known Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw for a long time as a
customer at a shop knows the staff in the background, mere office
secretions, who only ooze out at intervals. For Bradshaw was not
strictly a counter-jumper, although Miss Wilson more than once spoke
of him so, adding, when it was pointed out to her that theoretically
he never went behind counters, by jumping or otherwise, that that
didn't make the slightest difference: the principle was the same.</p>

<p>Sally's mother did not share her friend's fancies. But she had not
confidence enough in the stability of the earth's crust to give way
freely to her liberalism, drive a coach-and-six through the Classes,
and talk to him freely about the shop. She did not know what a
Social Seismologist would say on the point. So she contented herself
with treating him as a matter of course, as a slight acquaintance
whom she saw often, merely asking him if that was he. To which the
reply was in the affirmative, like question-time in the Commons.</p>

<p>"Is this the Strad? Let's have it out," says Sally. For Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw
possessed a Strad. He brought it out of its coffin with something of
the solicitude Petrarch might have shown to the remains of Laura,
and when he had rough-sketched its condition of discord and
corrected the drawing, danced a Hungarian dance on it, and
apologized for his presumption in doing so. He played so very well
that it certainly did seem rather a cruel trick of fate that gave
him nerves in his head. Sally then said, might she look at it? and
played chords and runs, just to feel what it was like. Her comment
was that she wished her viola was a Strad.</p>

<p>We record all this to show what, perhaps, is hardly worth the
showing&mdash;a wavering in a man's mind, and that man a young one. Are
they not at it all day long, all of them? Do they do anything but
waver?</p>

<p>When Sally said she wished her viola was a Strad, Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw's

<!-- Page 110 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
mind shortly became conscious that some passing spook, of a low
nature, had murmured almost inaudibly that it was a good job <i>his</i>
Strad wasn't a viola. "Because, you see," added the spook, "that
quashes all speculation whether you, Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw, are glad or sorry
you needn't lay your instrument at this young lady's feet. Now, if
immediately after you first had that overwhelming impression of
her&mdash;got metaphorically torpedoed, don't you know?&mdash;such a wish as
hers had been expressed, you probably would have laid both your
Strad and your heart at her feet, and said take my all!" But now
that he had been so far disillusioned by Sally's robust and breezy
treatment of the position, he was not quite sure the spook had not
something to say for himself. Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw was content to come down
off his high horse, and to plod along the dull path of a mere
musical evening visitor at a very nice house. Pleasant, certainly,
but not the aim of his aspirations from afar at St.&nbsp;Satisfax's. His
<i>amour propre</i> was a little wounded by that spook, too. Nothing
keeps it up to the mark better than a belief in one's stability&mdash;in
love-matters, especially.</p>

<p>He was not quite sure of the exact moment the spook intruded his
opinion, so <i>we</i> can't be expected to know. Perhaps about the time
Miss Wilson came in (just as he was showing how carefully he had
listened to Joachim) and said could <i>he</i> play those? She wished
<i>she</i> could. She was thrown off her guard by the finished execution,
and for the moment quite forgot Cattley's and the classitudes. Sally
instantly perceived her opening. She would enjoy catching Tishy out
in any sort of way. So she said: "Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw will show you how,
Tishy dear; of course he will. Only, not now, because if we don't
begin, we shan't have time for the long quartet." If you say this
sort of thing about strangers in Society, you really ought to give
them a chance. So thought L&aelig;titia to herself, and resolved to blow
Sally up at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>As for that culprit, she completed her work, from her own position
of perfect security, with complacency at least. And she felt at the
end of her evening (which we needn't dwell on, as it was all
crotchets, minims, and F sharps and G flats) that her entrenchments
had become spontaneously stronger without exertion on her part. For
there were Tishy and Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw, between

<!-- Page 111 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
whom Sally had certainly
understood there was a great gulf fixed, sitting on the very same
sofa and talking about a Stradivarius. She concluded that, broadly
speaking, Debrett's bark is worse than his bite, and that he is, at
heart, a very accommodating character.</p>

<p>"I hope you saw Tishy, mamma dear." So spoke Sally to her mother,
after the musicians first, and then Fenwick, had dispersed their
several ways. Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale seemed very <i>distraite</i> and
preoccupied.</p>

<p>"Saw Tishy what, kitten?"</p>

<p>"Tishy and Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw on that sofa."</p>

<p>"No, darling. Oh yes, I did. What about them?"</p>

<p>"After all that rumpus about shop-boys!" But her mother's attention
is not easy to engage this evening, somehow. Her mind seems
somewhere else altogether. But from where it is, it sees the vulgar
child very plainly indeed, as she puts up her face to be kissed with
all its animation on it. She kisses it, animation and all, caressing
the rich black hair with a hand that seems thoughtful. A hand can.
Then she makes a little effort to shake off something that draws her
away, and comes back rather perfunctorily to her daughter's sphere
of interest and the life of town.</p>

<p>"Did L&aelig;titia call Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw a shop-boy, chick?"</p>

<p>"Very nearly&mdash;at least, I don't know what you call not calling
anybody shop-boy if she didn't." Her mother makes a further
effort&mdash;comes back a little more.</p>

<p>"What did she say, child?"</p>

<p>"Said you could always tell, and it was no use my talking, and the
negro couldn't change his spots."</p>

<p>"She has some old-fashioned ideas. But how about calling him a
shop-boy?"</p>

<p>"Not in words, but worse. Tishy always goes round and round. I wish
she'd <i>say</i>! However, Dr.&nbsp;Vereker quite agrees with me. <i>We</i> think
it <i>dishonest</i>!"</p>

<p>"What did Dr.&nbsp;Vereker think of Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw?" We have failed to note
that the doctor was the 'cello in the quartet.</p>

<p>"Now, mamma darling, fancy asking Dr.&nbsp;Prosy what he thinks! I wasn't
going to. Besides, as if it mattered what they think of each
other!... Who? Why, men, of course!"</p>

<p>"Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's a man, and you asked him."</p>

<p>"Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's a man on other lines&mdash;absolutely other. He doesn't
come in really." Her mother repeats the last four words, not exactly
derisively&mdash;rather, if anything, her accent and her smile may be
said to caress her daughter's words as she says them. She is such a
silly, but such a dear little goose&mdash;that seems the implication.</p>

<p>"We-e-ll," says Sally, as she has said before, and we have tried to
spell her. "I don't see anything in that, because, look how
reasonable! Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's ... Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's ... why, of course,
entirely different. I say, mother dearest...."</p>

<p>"What, kitten?"</p>

<p>"What were you and Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick talking about so seriously in the
back drawing-room?" The two are upstairs in the front bedroom at
this minute, by-the-bye.</p>

<p>"Did you hear us, darling?"</p>

<p>"No, because of the row. But one could tell, for all that." Then
Sally sees in an instant that it is something her mother is not
going to tell her about, and makes immediate concession. "Where was
the Major going that he couldn't come?" she asks. "He generally
makes a point of coming when it's music."</p>

<p>"I fancy he's dining at the Hurkaru," says her mother. But she has
gone back into her preoccupation, and from within it externalises an
opinion that we should be better in bed, or we shall never be up in
the morning.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="subhead">WHAT FENWICK AND SALLY'S MOTHER HAD BEEN SAYING IN THE BACK
DRAWING-ROOM. OP.&nbsp;999. BACK IN THAT OLD GARDEN AGAIN, AND HOW GERRY
COULD NOT SWIM. THE OLD TARTINI SONATA</p>

<p>As soon as ever Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw touched his violin, and before ever he
began to play his Hungarian Dance on all four strings at once, Mrs.
Nightingale and Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick went away into the back drawing-room,
not to be too near the music. Because there was a fire in both
rooms.</p>

<p>In the interval of time that had passed since Christmas Sally had
contrived to "dismiss from her mind" Colonel Lund's previsions about
her mother and Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick. Or they had given warning, and gone of
their own accord. For by now she had again fallen into the frame of
mind which classified her mother and Fenwick as semi-elderly people,
and, so to speak, out of it all. So her mind assented readily to
distance from the music as a sufficient reason for a secession to
the back room. Non-combatants are just as well off the field of
battle.</p>

<p>But a closer observer than Sally at this moment would have noticed
that chat in an undertone had already set in in the back
drawing-room even before the Hungarians had stopped dancing. Also
that the applause that came therefrom, when they did stop, had a
certain perfunctory air, as of plaudits something else makes room
for, and comes back again after. Not that she would have "seen
anything in it" if she had, because, whatever her mother said or did
was, in Sally's eyes, right and normal. Abnormal and bad things were
conceived and executed outside the family. Nor, in spite of the
<i>sotto voce</i>, was there anything Sally could not have participated
in, whatever exception she might have taken to something of a
patronising tone, inexcusable towards our own generation even in the
most semi-elderly people on record.</p>

<p>Her mother, at Sally's latest observation point, had taken the

<!-- Page 114 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
large armchair quite on the other side of the rug, to be as far off
the music as possible. Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick, in reply to a flying remark of
her own, she being at the moment a music-book seeker, wouldn't bring
the other large armchair in front of the fire and be comfortable,
thank you. He liked this just as well. Sally had then commented on
Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's unnatural love of uncomfortable chairs "when he wasn't
walking about the room." She fancied, as she passed on, that she
heard her mother address him as "Fenwick," without the "Mr." So she
did.</p>

<p>"You are a restless man, Fenwick! I wonder were you so before the
accident? Oh dear! there I am on that topic again!" But he only
laughed.</p>

<p>"It doesn't hurt <i>me</i>," he said. "That reminds me that I wanted to
remind <i>you</i> of something you said you would tell me. You know&mdash;that
evening the kitten went to the music-party&mdash;something you would tell
me some time."</p>

<p>"I know; I'll tell you when they've got to their music, if there
isn't too much row. Don't let's talk while this new young man's
playing; it seems unkind. It won't matter when they're all at it
together." But in spite of good resolutions silence was not properly
observed, and the perfunctory pause came awkwardly on the top of a
lapse. Fenwick then said, as one who avails himself of an
opportunity:</p>

<p>"No need to wait for the music; they can't hear a word we say in
there. We can't hear a word <i>they</i> say."</p>

<p>"Because they're making such a racket." Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale paused with
a listening eye, trying to disprove their inaudibility. The
examination confirmed Fenwick. "I like it," she continued&mdash;"a lot of
young voices. It's much better when you don't make out what they
say. When you can't hear a word, you fancy some sense in it." And
then went on listening, and Fenwick waited, too. He couldn't well
fidget her to keep her promise; she would do it of herself in time.
It might be she preferred talking under cover of the music. She
certainly remained silent till it came; then she spoke.</p>

<p>"What was it made me say that to you about something I would tell
you? Oh, I know. You said, perhaps if you knew your past, you would
not court catechism about it. And I said that, knowing mine, <i>I</i>
should not either. Wasn't that it?" She

<!-- Page 115 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
fixed her eyes on him as
though to hold him to the truth. Perhaps she wanted his verbal
recognition of the possibility that she, too, like others, might
have left things in the past she would like to forget on their
merits&mdash;cast-off garments on the road of life. It may have been
painful to her to feel his faith in herself an obstacle to what she
wished at least to hint to him, even if she could not tell him
outright. She did not want too much divine worship at her shrine&mdash;a
ready recognition of her position of mortal frailty would be so much
more sympathetic, really. A feeling perhaps traceably akin to what
many of us have felt, that if our father the devil&mdash;"auld Nickie
Ben"&mdash;would only tak' a thought and mend, as he aiblins might, he
would be the very king of father confessors. If details had to be
gone into, we should be sure of <i>his</i> sympathy.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was it. And I suppose I looked incredulous." Thus
Fenwick.</p>

<p>"You looked incredulous. I would sooner you should believe me. Would
you hand me down that fire-screen off the chimney-piece? Thank you."
She was hardening herself to the task she had before her. He gave
her the screen, and as he resumed his seat drew it nearer to her.
Mozart's Op.&nbsp;999 had just started, and it was a little doubtful if
voices could be heard unless, in Sally's phrase, they were close to.</p>

<p>"I shall believe you. Does what you were going to tell me relate
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"To your husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The task had become easier suddenly. She breathed more freely
about what was to come. "I wish you to know that he may be still
living. I have heard nothing to the contrary. But I ought to speak
of him as the man who was my husband. He is no longer that." Fenwick
interposed on her hesitation.</p>

<p>"You have divorced him?" But she shook her head&mdash;shook a long
negative. And Fenwick looked up quickly, and uttered a little sharp
"Ah!" as though something had struck him. The slow head-shake said
as plain as words could have said it, "I wish I could say yes." So
expressive was it that Fenwick did not even speculate on the third
alternative&mdash;a separation without

<!-- Page 116 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
a divorce. He saw at once he
could make it easier for her if he spoke out plain, treating the
bygone as a thing that <i>could</i> be spoken of plainly.</p>

<p>"He divorced you?" She was very white, but kept her eyes steadily
fixed on him over the fire-screen, and her voice remained perfectly
firm and collected. The music went on intricately all the while. She
spoke next.</p>

<p>"To all intents and purposes. There was a technical obstacle to a
legal divorce, but he tried for one. We parted sorely against my
will, for I loved him, and now it is over nineteen years since I saw
him last, or heard of him or from him. But he was absolutely
blameless. Unless, indeed, it is to be counted blame to him that he
could not bear what no other man could have borne. I cannot possibly
give you all details. But I wish you to hear this that I have to
tell you from myself. It is painful to me to tell, but it would be
far worse that you should hear it from any one else. I feel sure it
is safe to tell you; that you will not talk of it to others&mdash;least
of all to that little chick of mine."</p>

<p>"You may trust me&mdash;indeed, you may&mdash;without reserve. I see you wish
to tell me no more, so I will not ask it."</p>

<p>"And blame me as little as possible?"</p>

<p>"I cannot blame you."</p>

<p>"Before you say that, listen to as much as I can tell you of the
story. I was a young girl when I went out alone to be married to him
in India. We had parted in England eight months before, and he had
remained unchanged&mdash;his letters all told the same tale. I quarrelled
with my mother&mdash;as I now see most unreasonably&mdash;merely because she
wished to marry again. Perhaps she was a little to blame not to be
more patient with a headstrong, ill-regulated girl. I was both. It
ended in my writing out to him in India that I should come out and
marry him at once. My mother made no opposition." She remained
silent for a little, and her eyes fell. Then she spoke with more
effort, rather as one who answers her own thoughts. "No, I need say
nothing of the time between. It was no excuse for the wrong I did
<i>him</i>. I can tell you what that was...." It did not seem easy,
though, when it came to actual words. Fenwick spoke into the pause.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 117 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Why tell me now? Tell me another time."</p>

<p>"I prefer now. It was this way: I kept something back from him till
after we were married&mdash;something I should have told him before. Had
I done so, I believe to this moment we should never have parted. But
my concealment threw doubt on all else I said.... I am telling more
than I meant to tell." She hesitated again, and then went on. "That
was my wrong to him&mdash;the concealment. But, of course, it was not the
ground of the divorce proceedings." Fenwick stopped her again.</p>

<p>"Why tell me any more? You are being led on&mdash;are leading yourself
on&mdash;to say more than you wish."</p>

<p>"Well, I will leave it there. Only, Fenwick, understand this: my
husband was young and generous and noble-hearted. Had I trusted him,
I believe all might have gone well, even though he...." She
hesitated again, and then cancelled something unsaid. "The
concealment was my fault&mdash;the mistrust. That was all. Nothing else
was my <i>fault</i>." As she says the words in praise of her husband she
finds it a pleasure to let her eyes rest on the grave, handsome,
puzzled face that, after all, really is <i>his</i>. She catches herself
wondering&mdash;so oddly do the undercurrents of mind course about&mdash;where
he got that sharp white scar across his nose. It was not there in
the old days.</p>

<p>She looks at him until he, too, looks up, and their eyes meet.
"Well, then," she says, "I will tell you no more. Blame me as little
as possible." And to this repetition of her previous words he says
again, "I cannot blame you," very emphatically.</p>

<p>But Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale felt perplexed at his evident sincerity; would
rather he should have indulged in truisms, we were not all of us
perfect, and so forth. When she spoke again, some bars of the music
later, she took for granted that his mind, like hers, was still
dwelling on his last words. She felt half sorry she had, so to
speak, switched off the current of the conversation.</p>

<p>"If you will think over what I have told you, Fenwick, you will see
that you cannot help doing so."</p>

<p>"How can that be?"</p>

<p>"Surely! My husband sought to divorce me, and was himself absolutely
blameless. How can you do otherwise than blame me?"</p>

<p>"Partly&mdash;only partly&mdash;because I see you are keeping back
something&mdash;something

<!-- Page 118 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
that would exonerate you. I cannot believe you
were to blame."</p>

<p>"Listen, Fenwick! As I said, I cannot tell you the whole; and the
Major, who is the only man alive who knows all the story, will, I
know, refuse to tell you anything, even if you ask him, and that I
wish you not to do."</p>

<p>"I should not dream of asking him."</p>

<p>"Well, he would refuse. I know it. But I want you to know all I can
tell you. I do not want any groundless excuses made for me. I will
not accept any absolution from any one on a false pretence. You see
what I mean."</p>

<p>"I see perfectly. I am not sure, though, that you see my meaning.
But never mind that. Is there anything further you would really like
me to know?"</p>

<p>She waited a little, and then answered, keeping her eyes always
fixed on Fenwick: "Yes, there is."</p>

<p>But at this moment the first movement of Op.&nbsp;999 came to a perfect
and well thought out conclusion, bearing in mind everything that had
been said on six pages of ideas faultlessly interchanged by four
instruments, and making due allowance for all exceptions each had
courteously taken to the other. But Op.&nbsp;999 was going on to the
second movement directly, and only tolerated a pause for a few
string-tightenings and trial-squeaks, to get in tune, and the
removal of a deceased fly from a piano-candle. The remark from the
back-room that we could hear beautifully in here seemed to fall
flat, the second violin merely replying "All right!" passionlessly.
The instruments then asked each other if they were ready, and
answered yes. Then some one counted four suggestively, for a start,
and life went on again.</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale and Fenwick sat well on into the music before
either spoke. He, resolved not to seem to seek or urge any
information at all; all was to come spontaneously from her. She,
feeling the difficulty of telling what she had to tell, and always
oppressed with the recollection of what it had cost her to make her
revelation to this selfsame man nineteen years ago. She wished he
would give the conversation some lift, as he had done before, when
he asked if what she had to tell referred to her husband. But,
although he would gladly have repeated his assistance, he could see
his way to nothing, this time, that seemed

<!-- Page 119 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
altogether free from
risk. How if he were to blunder into ascribing to her something more
culpable than her actual share in the past? She half guessed this;
then, seeing that speech must come from herself in the end, took
heart and faced the position resolutely. She always did.</p>

<p>"You know this, Fenwick, do you not, that when there is a divorce,
the husband takes the children from their mother&mdash;always, when she
is in the wrong; too often, when she is blameless. I have told you I
was the one to blame, and I tell you now that though my husband's
application for a divorce failed, from a technical point of law, all
things came about just as though he had succeeded. Don't analyse it
now; take it all for granted&mdash;you understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand. Suppose it so! And then?"</p>

<p>"And then this. That little monkey of mine&mdash;that little unconscious
fiddling thing in there"&mdash;and as Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale speaks, the sound
of a caress mixes with the laugh in her voice; but the pain comes
back as she goes on&mdash;"My Sallykin has been mine, all her life! My
poor husband never saw her in her childhood." As she says the word
<i>husband</i> she has again a vivid <i>&eacute;clat</i> of the consciousness that it
is he&mdash;himself&mdash;sitting there beside her. And the odd thought that
mixes itself into this, strange to say, is&mdash;"The pity of it! To
think how little he has had of Sally in all these years!"</p>

<p>He, for his part, can for the moment make nothing of this part of
the story. He can give his head the lion-mane shake she knows him by
so well, but it brings him no light. He is reduced to mere slow
repetition of her data; his hand before his eyes to keep his brain,
that has to think, clear of distractions from without.</p>

<p>"Your husband never saw her. She has been yours all her life. Had
she been your husband's child, he would have exercised his so-called
rights&mdash;his <i>legal</i> rights&mdash;and taken her away. Are those the
facts&mdash;so far?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;go on. No&mdash;stop; I will tell you. At the beginning of this
year I should have been married exactly twenty years. Sally is
nineteen&mdash;you remember her birthday?"</p>

<p>"Nineteen in August. Now, let me think!" Just at this moment the
second movement of Op.&nbsp;999 came to an end, and gave

<!-- Page 120 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
an added
plausibility to the blank he needed to ponder in. The viola in the
next room looked round across her chair-back, and said, "I say,
mother"&mdash;to a repetition of which Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale replied what did
her daughter say? What she said was that her mother and Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick
were exactly like the canaries. They talked as hard as they could
all through the music, and when it stopped they shut up. Wasn't that
true? To which her mother answered affirmatively, adding, "You'll
have to put a cloth over us, chick, and squash us out."</p>

<p>Fenwick was absorbed in thought, and did not notice this interlude.
He did not speak until the music began again. Then he said abruptly:</p>

<p>"I see the story now. Sally's father was not...."</p>

<p>"Was not my husband." There is not a trace of cowardice or
hesitation in her filling out the sentence. There is pain, but that
again dies away in her voice as she goes on to speak of her
daughter. "I do not connect him with her now. She is&mdash;a thing of
itself&mdash;a thing of herself! She is&mdash;she is Sally. Well, you see what
she is."</p>

<p>"I see she is a very dear little person." Then he seems to want to
say something and to pause on the edge of it; then, in answer to a
"yes" of encouragement from her, continues, "I was going to say that
she must be very like him&mdash;like her father."</p>

<p>"Very like?" she asks&mdash;"or very unlike? Which did you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean very like as to looks. Because she is so unlike you."</p>

<p>"She is like enough to him, as far as looks go. It's her only fault,
poor chick, and <i>she</i> can't help it. Besides, I mind it less now
that I have more than half forgiven him, for her sake." The tone of
her voice mixes a sob and a laugh, although she utters neither, and
is quite collected. "But she is quite unlike him in character. Sally
is not an angel&mdash;oh dear, no!" The laugh predominates. "But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"She is not a devil." And as she said this the pain was all back
again in the dropped half-whisper in which she said it. And in that
moment Fenwick made his guess of the whole story, which maybe went
nearer than we shall do with the information we

<!-- Page 121 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
have to go upon. In
this narrative, as we tell it now, that story is <i>known</i> only to its
chief actor, and to her old friend who is now dining at the Hurkaru
Club.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>The third movement of Op.&nbsp;999 was not a very long one, and, coming
to an end at this point, seemed to supply a reason for silence that
was not unwelcome in the back drawing-room. The end of a trying
conversation had been attained. Both speakers could now affect
attention to what was going on in the front. This had taken the form
of a discussion between Mr.&nbsp;Julius Bradshaw and Miss L&aelig;titia Wilson,
who was anxious to transfer her position of first violin to that
young gentleman. We regret to have to report that Miss Sally's
agreement with her friend about the desirability had been <i>sotto
voce</i>'d in these terms: "Yes, Tishy dear! Do make the shop-boy play
the last movement." And Miss Wilson had then suggested it, saying
there was a bit she knew she couldn't play. "And you expect <i>me</i>
to!" said the owner of the Strad, "when I haven't so much as looked
at it for three years past." To which Miss Sally appended a marginal
note, "Stuff and nonsense! Don't be affected, Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw."
However, after compliments, and more protestations from its owner,
the Strad was brought into hotchpot, and L&aelig;titia abdicated.</p>

<p>"Won't you come and sit in here, to be away from the music?" said
the back-drawing-room. But L&aelig;titia wanted to see Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw's
fingering of that passage. We are more interested in the back
drawing-room.</p>

<p>Like many other athletic men&mdash;and we have seen how strongly this
character was maintained in Fenwick&mdash;he hated armchairs. Even in the
uncomfortable ones&mdash;by which we mean the ones <i>we</i> dislike&mdash;his
restless strength would not remain quiet for any length of time. At
intervals he would get up and walk about the room, exasperating the
sedate, and then making good-humoured concession to their weakness.
Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale could remember all this in Gerry the boy, twenty
years ago.</p>

<p>If it had not been for that music, probably he would have walked
about the room over that stiff problem in dates he had just grappled
with. As it was, he remained in his chair to solve it&mdash;that is, if
he did solve it. Possibly, the moment he saw something

<!-- Page 122 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
important
turned on the date of Sally's birth, he jumped across the solution
to the conclusion it was to lead to. Given the conclusion, the
calculation had no interest for him.</p>

<p>But the story his mind constructed to fit that conclusion stunned
him. It knitted his brows and clenched his teeth for him. It made
the hand that had been hanging loose over the uncomfortable
chair-back close savagely on something&mdash;a throat, perhaps, that his
imagination supplied? How like he looked, thought his companion, to
himself on one occasion twenty years ago! But his anger now was on
her behalf alone; it was not so in that dreadful time she hoped he
might never recollect. If only his memory of all the past might
remain as now, a book with a locked clasp and a lost key!</p>

<p>She watched him as he sat there, and saw a calmer mood come back
upon him. Each wanted a <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> for a silent pause, and
neither was sorry for the desire each might ascribe to the other of
hearing the last movement of the music undisturbed. Op.&nbsp;999 was
prospering, there was no doubt of it! L&aelig;titia Wilson was a very fair
example of a creditable career at the R.A.M. But she was not quite
equal to this unfortunate victim of a too nervous system, who could
play like an angel for half an hour, mind you&mdash;not more. This was
his half-hour; and it was quite reasonable for Fenwick to take for
granted that his hostess would like to pay attention to it, or
<i>vice-versa</i>. So both sat silent.</p>

<p>But as she sat listening to Op.&nbsp;999, and watching wonderingly the
strange victim of oblivion, of whom she knew&mdash;scarcely acknowledging
it always, though&mdash;that she had once for a short time called him
husband, her mind went back to an old time when he and she were
young: before the tragic memory that she sometimes thought might
have been lived down had come into her life and his. And a scene
rose up before her out of that old time&mdash;a scene of young men,
almost boys, and girls who but the other day were in the nursery,
playing lawn-tennis in a happy garden, with never a thought for
anything in this wide world but themselves, and each other, and the
scoring, and how jolly it would be in the house-boat at Henley
to-morrow. And then this garden-scene a little later in the
moonrise, and herself and one of the players, who was Gerry&mdash;this
very man&mdash;left

<!-- Page 123 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
by the other two to themselves, on a garden-seat his
arm hung over, just as it did now over that chair-back. How exactly
he sat then as he sat now, his other hand in charge of the foot he
had crossed on his knee, just as now, to keep it from a slip along
his lawn-tennis flannels! How well she could remember the
tennis-shoe, with its ribbed rubber sole, in place of that
highly-polished calf thing! And she could remember every word they
said, there in the warm moonlight.</p>

<p>"What a silly boy you are!"</p>

<p>"I don't care. I shall always say exactly the same. I can't help
it."</p>

<p>"All silly boys say that sort of thing. Then they change their
minds."</p>

<p>"I never said it to any girl in my life but you, Rosey. I never
thought it. I shall never say it again to any one but you."</p>

<p>"Don't be nonsensical!"</p>

<p>"I'm <i>not</i>! It's <i>true</i>."</p>

<p>"Wait till you've been six months in India, Gerry."</p>

<p>And then the recollection of what followed made it seem infinitely
strange to her that Fenwick should remain, as he had remained,
immovable. If the hand she could remember so well, for all it had
grown so scarred and service-worn and hairy, were to take hers as it
did then, as they sat together on the garden-seat, would it shake
now as formerly? If his great strong arm her memory still felt round
her were to come again now, would she feel in it the tremor of the
passion he was shaken by then; and in caresses such as she half
reproved him for, but had no heart to resist, the reality of a love
then young and strong and full of promise for the days to come? And
now&mdash;what? The perished trunk of an uprooted tree: the shadow of a
half-forgotten dream.</p>

<p>As he sat silent, only now and then by some slight sign, some new
knitting of the brow or closing of the hand, showing the tension of
the feeling produced by the version his mind had made of the story
half told to him&mdash;as he sat thus, under a kind of feint of listening
to the music, the world grew stranger and stranger to his companion.
She had fancied herself strong enough to tell the story, but had
hardly reckoned with his possible likeness to himself. She had
thought that she could keep

<!-- Page 124 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the twenty years that had passed
clearly in her mind; could deal with the position from a good,
sensible, matter-of-fact standpoint.</p>

<p>The past was past, and happily forgotten by him. The present had
still its possibilities, if only the past might remain forgotten.
Surely she could rely on herself to find the nerve to go through
what was, after all, a mere act of duty. Knowing, or rather feeling,
that Fenwick would ask her to marry him as soon as he dared&mdash;it was
merely a question of time&mdash;her duty was plainly to forewarn him&mdash;to
make sure that he was alive to the antecedents of the woman he was
offering himself to. She knew <i>his</i> antecedents; as many as she
wished to know. If the twenty years of oblivion concealed
irregularity, immorality&mdash;well, was she not to blame for it? Was
ever a better boy than Gerry, as she knew him, to the day they
parted? It was her fault or misfortune that had cast him all adrift.
As to that troublesome question of a possible wife elsewhere, in the
land of his oblivion, she had quite made up her mind about that.
Every effort had been made to find such a one, and failed. If she
reappeared, it would be her own duty to surrender Fenwick&mdash;if he
wished to go back. If he did not, and his other wife wished to be
free, surely in the <i>chicane</i> of the law-courts there must be some
shuffle that could be for once made useful to a good end.</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale had reasoned it all out in cold blood, and she was,
as we have told you, a strong woman. But had she really taken her
own measure? Could she sit there much longer; with him beside her,
and his words of twenty years ago sounding in her ears; almost the
feeling of the kisses she had so dutifully pointed out the
lawlessness, and allowed the repetition of, in that old forgotten
time&mdash;forgotten by him, never by her! Was it possible to bear,
without crying out, the bewilderment of a mixed existence such as
that his presence and identity forced upon her, wrenching her this
way and that, interweaving the woof of <i>then</i> with the weft of
<i>now</i>, even as in that labyrinth of musical themes and phrases in
the other room they crossed and recrossed one another at the bidding
of each instrument as its turn came to tell its tale? Her brain
reeled and her heart ached under the intolerable stress. Could she
still hold on, or would she be, after all, driven to make some
excuse, and run for the solitude

<!-- Page 125 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of her own room to live down the
tension as best she might alone?</p>

<p>The music itself came to her assistance. Its triumphant strength, in
an indescribable outburst of hope or joy or mastery of Fate, as it
drew near to its final close, spoke to her of the great ocean that
lies beyond the crabbed limits of our stinted lives, the boundless
sea our rivulets of life steal down to, to be lost in; and while it
lasted made it possible for her to be still. She took her eyes from
Fenwick, and waited. When she raised them again, in the silence Op.
999 came to an end in, she saw that he had moved. His face had gone
into his hands; and as she looked up, his old action of rubbing them
into his loose hair, and shaking it, had come back, and his strong
identity with his boyhood, dependent on the chance of a moment, had
disappeared. He got up suddenly, and after a turn across the room he
was in, walked into the other one, and contributed his share to the
babble of felicitation or comment that followed what was clearly
thought an achievement in musical rendering.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear!" said L&aelig;titia Wilson. "Was ever a poor girl so
sat upon? I feel quite flat!" This was not meant to be taken too
much <i>au pied de la lettre</i>. It was merely a method of praise of Mr.
Bradshaw.</p>

<p>"But what a jolly shame you had to give it up!" This was Sally in
undisguised admiration. But in Mr.&nbsp;Julius Bradshaw's eyes, Sally's
identity had undergone a change. Her breezy frankness had made hay
of a <i>grande passion</i>, and was blowing the hay all over the field.
He had come close to, and had a good look; but he will hardly go
away in a huff, although he feels a little silly over his public
worship of these past weeks. Just at this moment of the story,
however, he is very apologetic towards Miss Wilson; on whom, if she
reports correctly, he has sat. He tries no pretences with a view to
her reinstatement, even on a par with himself. He knows, and every
one knows, they would be seen through immediately. It is no use
assuring her she is a capital player, of her years. Much better let
it alone!</p>

<p>"Are you any the worse, Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw?" says Dr.&nbsp;Vereker. Obviously,
as a medical authority, it is his duty to "voice" this inquiry. So
he voices it.</p>

<div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"N&mdash;no; but that's about as much as I can do, with safety. It won't
do to spoil my night's rest, and be late at the shop." It was easy
to talk about the shop with perfect unreserve after such a
performance as that.</p>

<p>"Oh dear! we are so sorry for you!" Thus the two girls. And
concurrence comes in various forms from Vereker, Fenwick, and the
pianist, whom we haven't mentioned before. He was a cousin of Miss
Wilson's, and was one of those unfortunate young men who have no
individuality whatever. But pianists have to be human unless you can
afford a pianola. You may speak of them as Mr.&nbsp;What's-his-name, or
Miss Thingummy, but you must give them tea or coffee or cake or
sandwiches, or whatever is brought in on a tray. This young man's
name, we believe, was Elsley&mdash;Nobody Elsley, Miss Sally in her
frivolity had thought fit to christen him. You know how in your own
life people come in and go out, and you never know anything about
them. Even so this young man in this story.</p>

<p>"I was very sorry for myself, I assure you"&mdash;it is Bradshaw who
speaks&mdash;"when I had to make up my mind to give it up. But it
couldn't be helped!" He speaks without reserve, but as of an
unbearable subject; in fact, Sally said afterwards to Tishy, "it
seemed as if he was going to cry." He doesn't cry, though, but goes
on: "At one time I really thought I should have gone and jumped into
the river."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you?" asks Sally. "I should have."</p>

<p>"Yes, silly Sally!" says L&aelig;titia; "and then you would have swum like
a fish. And the police would have pulled you out. And you would have
looked ridiculous!"</p>

<p>But Sally is off on a visit to her mother in the next room.</p>

<p>"Tired, mammy darling?"</p>

<p>She kisses her, and her mother answers: "Yes, love, a little," and
kisses her back.</p>

<p>"Doesn't he play <i>beautifully</i>, mother?" says Sally.</p>

<p>But her mother says "Yes" absently. Her attention is taken off by
something else. What is wrong with Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick? Sally doesn't think
anything is. It's only his way.</p>

<p>"I'm sure there's something wrong," says Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale, and gets
up to go into the front-room rather wearily. "I shall go

<!-- Page 127 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
to bed
soon, poppet," she says, "and leave you to do the honours. Is
anything wrong, doctor?" She speaks under her voice to Vereker,
looking very slightly round at Fenwick, who, after the movement that
alarmed her&mdash;a rather unusually marked head-shake and pressure of
his hands on his eyes&mdash;is standing looking down at the fire, on the
rug with his back to her, as she speaks to Vereker.</p>

<p>"I fancy he's had what he calls a recurrence," says the doctor.
"Nothing to hurt. These half-recollections will go on until the
memory comes back in earnest. It may some time."</p>

<p>"Are you talking about me, doctor?" His attention may have been
caught by a reflection in a glass before him. "Yes, it was a very
queer recurrence. Something about lawn-tennis. Only it had to do
with what Miss Wilson said about the police fishing Sally out of the
water." He looks round for Miss Wilson, but she is at the other end
of the room on a sofa talking to Bradshaw about the Strad, as
recorded once before. Sally testifies:</p>

<p>"Tishy said it wouldn't work&mdash;trying to drown yourself if you could
swim. No more it would."</p>

<p>"But why should that make me think of lawn-tennis? It did." He looks
seriously distressed by it&mdash;can make nothing out.</p>

<p>"Kitten," says Sally's mother to her suddenly, "I think I shall go
away to bed. I'm feeling very tired."</p>

<p>She says good-night comprehensively, and departs. But she is so
clearly the worse for something that her daughter follows her to see
that the something is not serious. Outside she reassures Sally, who
returns. Oh no, she is only tired; really nothing else.</p>

<p>But what drove her out of the room was a feeling that she must be
alone and silent. Could her position be borne at all? Yes, with
patience and self-control. But that "why should it make me think of
lawn-tennis?" was trying. Not only the pain of still more revived
association, but the fear that his memory might travel still further
into the past. It was living on the edge of the volcano.</p>

<p>Her own memory had followed on, too, taking up the thread of that
old interview in the garden of twenty years ago. She had

<!-- Page 128 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
felt again
the clasp of his arm, the touch of his hand; had heard his voice of
passionate protest&mdash;protest against the idea that he could ever
forget. And she had then pretended to make a half-joke of his
earnestness. What would he do now, really, if she were to tell him
she preferred his great friend Arthur Fenwick to him? That was
nonsense, he said. She knew she didn't. Besides, Arthur wanted
Jessie Nairn. Why, didn't they waltz all the waltzes at the party
last week?... Well, so did we, for that matter, all-but.... And just
look how they had run away together! Wasn't that them coming back?
Yes, it was; and artificial calm ensued, and more self-contained
manners. But then, before the other two young lovers could rejoin
them, she had time for a word more.</p>

<p>"No, dear Gerry, seriously. If I were to write out <i>no</i> to you in
India&mdash;a great big final <span class="smcap">no</span>&mdash;then
what do you think you would do?"</p>

<p>"I know what I <i>think</i> I should do. I should throw myself into the
Hooghly or the Ganges."</p>

<p>"You silly boy! You would swim about, whether you liked or no. And
then Jemadars, or Shastras, or Sudras, or something would come and
pull you out. And then how ridiculous you would look!"</p>

<p>"No, Rosey, because I can't swim. Isn't it funny?"</p>

<p>Then she recollected <i>his</i> friend's voice striking in with: "What's
that? Gerry Palliser swim! Of course he can't. He can wrestle, or
run, or ride, or jump; and he's the best man I know with the gloves
on. But swim he <i>can't</i>! That's flat!" Also how Gerry had then told
eagerly how he was nearly drowned once, and Arthur fished him up
from the bottom of Abingdon Lock. The latter went on:</p>

<p>"It was after that we tattooed each other, his name on my arm, my
name on his, so as not to quarrel. You know, I suppose, that men who
tattoo each other's arms can't quarrel if they try?" Arthur showed
"A. Palliser," tattooed blue on his arm. Both young men were very
grave and earnest about the safeguard. And then she remembered a
question she asked, and how both replied with perfect gravity: "Of
course, sure to!" The question had been:&mdash;Was it invariable that all
men quarrelled if one saved the other from drowning?</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 129 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
</div>

<p>She sits upstairs alone by the fire in her bedroom, and dreams again
through all the past, except the nightmare of her life&mdash;<i>that</i> she
always shudders away from. Sally will come up presently, and then
she will feel ease again. Now, it is a struggle against fever.</p>

<p>She can hear plainly enough&mdash;for the house is but a London suburban
villa&mdash;the strains from the drawing-room of what is possibly the
most hackneyed violin music in the world&mdash;the Tartini (so-called)
Devil Sonata&mdash;every phrase, every run, every chord an enthralling
mystery still, an utterance none can explain, an inexhaustible thing
no age can wither, and no custom stale. It is so soothing to her
that it matters little if it makes them late. But that young man
will destroy his nerves to a certainty outright.</p>

<p>Then comes the chaos of dispersal&mdash;the broken fragments of the
intelligible a watchful ear may pick out. Dr.&nbsp;Vereker won't have a
cab; he will leave the 'cello till next time, and walk. Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw
wants to get to Bayswater. Of course, that's all in our way&mdash;we
being Miss Wilson and the cousin, the nonentity. We can give Mr.
Bradshaw a lift as far as he goes, and then he can take the growler
on. Then more good-nights are wished than the nature of things will
admit of before to-morrow, Fenwick and Vereker light something to
smoke, with a preposterous solicitude to use only one tandsticker
between them, and walk away umbrella-less. From which we see that
"it" is holding up. Then comes silence, and a consciousness of a
policeman musing, and suspecting doors have been left stood open.</p>

<p>And it was then Sally went upstairs and indited her friend for
sitting on that sofa after calling him a shop-boy. And she didn't
forget it, either, for after she and her mother were in bed, and
presumably better, she called out to her.</p>

<p>"I say, mammy!"</p>

<p>"What, dear?"</p>

<p>"Isn't that St.&nbsp;John's Church?"</p>

<p>"Isn't which St.&nbsp;John's Church?"</p>

<p>"Where Tishy goes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ladbroke Grove Road. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because now Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw will go there&mdash;public worship!"</p>

<p>"Will he, dear? Suppose we go to sleep." But she really meant

<!-- Page 130 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
"you," not "we"; for it was a long time before she went to sleep
herself. She had plenty to think of, and wanted to be quiet,
conscious of Sally in the neighbourhood.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>We hope our reader was not misled, as we ourselves were, when Mrs.
Nightingale first saw the name on Fenwick's arm, into supposing that
she accepted it as his real name. She knew better. But then, how was
she to tell him his name was Palliser? Think it over.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF A SLEEPLESS NIGHT MRS. NIGHTINGALE HAD, AND HOW SALLY WOKE UP AND
TALKED</p>

<p>Was it possible, thought Rosalind in the sleepless night that
followed, that the recurrence of the tennis-garden in Fenwick's mind
might grow and grow, and be a nucleus round which the whole memory
of his life might re-form? Even so she had seen, at a chemical
lecture, a supersaturated solution, translucent and spotless,
suddenly fill with innumerable ramifications from one tiny crystal
dropped into it. Might not this shred of memory chance to be a
crystal of the right salt in the solvent of his mind, and set going
a swift arborescence to penetrate the whole? Might not one branch of
that tree be a terrible branch&mdash;one whose leaves and fruit were
poisoned and whose stem was clothed with thorns? A hideous metaphor
of the moment&mdash;call it the worst in her life&mdash;when her young
husband, driven mad with the knowledge that had just forced its way
into his reluctant mind, had almost struck her away from him, and
with angry words, of which the least was traitress, had broken
through the effort of her hands to hold him, and left her speechless
in her despair.</p>

<p>It was such a nightmare idea, this anticipation that next time she
met Gerry's eyes she might see again the anger that was in them on
that blackest of her few married days, might see him again vanish
from her, this time never to return. And it spread an ever growing
horror, greater and greater in the silence and the darkness of the
night, till it filled all space and became a power that thrilled
through every nerve, and denied the right of any other thing in the
infinite void to be known or thought of. Which of us has not been
left, with no protection but our own weak resolutions, to the mercy
of a dominant idea in the still

<!-- Page 132 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
hours when others were near us
sleeping whom we might not wake to say one word to save us?</p>

<p>What would his face be like&mdash;how would his voice sound&mdash;when she saw
him next? Or would some short and cruel letter come to say he had
remembered all, and now&mdash;for all the gratitude he owed her&mdash;he could
not bear to look upon her face again, hers who had done him such a
wrong! If so, what should she&mdash;what could she do?</p>

<p>There was only one counter-thought to this that brought with it a
momentary balm. She would send Sally to him to beg, beseech, implore
him not to repeat his headstrong error of the old years, to swear to
him that if only he could know all he would forgive&mdash;nay, more, that
if he could know quite all&mdash;the very whole of the sad story&mdash;not
only would he forgive, but rather seek forgiveness for himself for
the too harsh judgment he so rashly formed.</p>

<p>What should she say to Sally? how should she instruct her to plead
for her? Never mind that now. All she wanted in her lonely, nervous
delirium was the ease the thought gave her, the mere thought of the
force of Sally's fixed, immovable belief&mdash;<i>that</i> she was certain
of&mdash;that whatsoever her mother had done was right. Never mind the
exact amount of revelation she would have to make to Sally. She
might surely indulge the idea, just to get at peace somehow,
till&mdash;as pray Heaven it might turn out&mdash;she should know that Gerry's
mind was still unconscious of its past. The chances were, so she
thought mechanically to herself, that all her alarms were
groundless.</p>

<p>And at the first&mdash;strange as it is to tell&mdash;Sally's identity was
only that of the daughter she had now, that filled her life, and
gave her the heart to live. She was the Sally space was full of for
her. <i>What</i> she was, and <i>why</i> she was, merged, as it usually did,
in the broad fact of her existence. But there was always the chance
that this <i>what</i> and <i>why</i>&mdash;two bewildering imps&mdash;should flaunt
their unsolved conundrum through her mother's baffled mind. There
they were, sure enough in the end, enjoying her inability to answer,
dragging all she prayed daily to be better able to forget out into
the light of the memory they had kindled. There they were, chuckling
over her misery, and hiding&mdash;so Rosalind feared&mdash;a worse question
than any, keeping it back for a

<!-- Page 133 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
final stroke to bring her mental
fever to its height&mdash;how could Sally be the daughter of a devil and
her soul be free from the taint of his damnation?</p>

<p>If Rosalind had only been well read in the medi&aelig;val classics, and
had known that story of Merlin's birth&mdash;the Nativity that was to
rewrite the Galilean story in letters of Hell, and give mankind for
ever to be the thrall of the fallen angel his father! And now the
babe at its birth was snatched away to the waters of baptism, and
poor Satan&mdash;alas!&mdash;obliged to cast about for some new plan of
campaign; which, to say truth, he must have found, and practised
with some success. But Rosalind had never read this story. Had she
done so she might have felt, as we do, that the tears of an
absolutely blameless mother might serve to cleanse the inherited sin
from a babe unborn as surely as the sacramental fount itself.</p>

<p>And it may be that some such thought had woven itself into the story
Fenwick's imagination framed for Rosalind the evening before&mdash;that
time that she said of Sally, "She is not a devil!" The exact truth,
the ever-present record that was in her mind as she said this, must
remain unknown to us.</p>

<p>But to return to her as she is now, racked by a twofold mental
fever, an apprehension of a return of Fenwick's memory, and a
stimulated recrudescence of her own; with the pain of all the scars
burnt in twenty years ago revived now by her talk with him of a few
hours since. She could bear it no longer, there alone in the
darkness of the night. She <i>must</i> get at Sally, if only to look at
her. Why, that child never could be got to wake unless shaken when
she was wanted. Ten to one she wouldn't this time. And it would make
all the difference just to see her there, alive and leagues away in
dreamland. If her sleep lasted through the crackle of a match to
light her candle, heard through the open door between their rooms,
the light of the candle itself wouldn't wake her. Rosalind
remembered as she lit the candle and found her dressing-gown&mdash;for
the night air struck cold&mdash;how once, when a ten-year-old, Sally had
locked herself in, and no noise or knocking would rouse her; how she
herself, alarmed for the child, had thereon summoned help, and the
door was broken open, but only to be greeted by the sleeper, after
explanation, with, "Why didn't you knock?"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 134 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
</div>

<p>She was right in her forecast, and perhaps it was as well the girl
did not wake. She would only have had a needless fright, to see her
mother, haggard with self-torment, by her bedside at that hour. So
Rosalind got her full look at the rich coils of black hair that
framed up the unconscious face, that for all its unconsciousness had
on it the contentment of an amused dreamer, at the white ivory skin
it set off so well, at the one visible ear that heard nothing, or if
it did, translated it into dream, and the faint rhythmic movement
that vouched for soundless breath. She looked as long as she dared,
then moved away. But she had barely got her head back on her pillow
when "Was that you, mother?" came from the next room. Her mother
always said of Sally that nothing was certain but the <i>impr&eacute;vu</i>, and
ascribed to her a monstrous perversity. It was this that caused her
to sleep profoundly through that most awakening of incidents, a
person determined not to disturb you, and then to wake up short into
that person's self-congratulations on success.</p>

<p>"Of course it was, darling. Who else could it have been?"</p>

<p>Sally's reply, "I thought it was," seems less reasonable&mdash;mere
conversation making&mdash;and a sequel as of one reviewing new and more
comfortable positions in bed follows naturally. A decision on the
point does not prohibit conversation, rather facilitates it.</p>

<p>"What did you come for, mammy?"</p>

<p>"Eau-de-Cologne." The voice has a fell intention of instant sleep in
it which Sally takes no notice of.</p>

<p>"Have you got it?"</p>

<p>"Got it? Yes. Go to sleep, chatterbox."</p>

<p>It was true about the eau-de-Cologne, for Rosalind, with a
self-acting instinct that explanation might be called for, had
picked up the bottle on her return journey. You see, she was always
practising wicked deceits and falsehoods, all to save that little
chit being made miserable on her account. But the chit wasn't going
to sleep again. She was going to enjoy her new attitude awake. Who
woke her up? Answer that.</p>

<p>"I say, mother!"</p>

<p>"What, kitten? Go to sleep."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 135 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"All right&mdash;in a minute. Do you remember Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's bottle of
eau-de-Cologne?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. Go to sleep."</p>

<p>"Just going. But wasn't it funny?"</p>

<p>"What funny?&mdash;Oh, the eau-de-Cologne!"</p>

<p>Rosalind isn't really sleepy, and may as well talk. "Yes, that was
very funny. I wonder where he got it." She seems roused, and her
daughter is repentant.</p>

<p>"Oh dear! What a shame! I've just spoiled your go-off. Poor mother!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, chick! I like to talk a little. It <i>was</i> funny that he
should have a big bottle of eau-de-Cologne, of all things, in his
pocket."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it was rummer still about Rosalind Nightingale&mdash;<i>his</i>
Rosalind Nightingale, the one he knew." This is dangerous ground,
and Rosalind knows it. But a plea of half-sleep will cover mistakes,
and conversation about the pre-electrocution period is the nearest
approach to taking Sally into her confidence that she can hope for.
She is so weary with her hours of wakefulness that she becomes a
little reckless, foreseeing a resource in such uncertainty of speech
as may easily be ascribed to a premature dream.</p>

<p>"It's not <i>impossible</i> that it should have been your grandmother,
kitten. But we can't find out now. And it wouldn't do us any good
that I can see."</p>

<p>"It would be nice to know for curiosity. Couldn't anything be fished
out in the granny connexion? No documents?"</p>

<p>"Nothing will ever be fished out by me in that connexion, Sally
darling." Sally knows from her mother's tone of voice that they are
approaching an <i>impasse</i>. She means to give up the point the moment
it comes fully in view. But she will go on until that happens. She
has to think out what was the name of the Sub-Dean before she speaks
again.</p>

<p>"Didn't the Reverend Decimus Ireson grab all the belongings?"</p>

<p>"They were left to him, child. It was all fair, as far as that goes.
I didn't grudge him the things&mdash;indeed, I felt rather grateful to
him for taking them. It would only have been painful,

<!-- Page 136 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
going over
them. Different people feel differently about these things. I didn't
want old recollections."</p>

<p>"Hadn't the Reverend Decimus a swarm of brats?"</p>

<p>"Sal&mdash;ly <i>dar</i>ling!... Well, yes, he had. There were two families.
One of six daughters, I forget which."</p>

<p>"Couldn't they be got at, to see if they wouldn't recollect
something?"</p>

<p>"Of course they could. They've married a lawyer&mdash;at least, one of
them has. And all the rest, I believe, live with them." At another
time Sally would have examined this case in relation to the Deceased
Wife's Sister Bill. She was too interested now to stop her mother
continuing: "But what a silly chick you are! Why should <i>they</i> know
anything about it?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't they?"</p>

<p>Her mother's reply is emphasized. "My dear, do consider! I was with
your grandmother till within a month of her marriage with the
Reverend, as you call him, and I should have been ten times more
likely to hear about Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick than ever they would afterwards.
Your grandmother had never even seen them when I went away to India
to be married."</p>

<p>"What's the lawyer's name?"</p>

<p>"Bearman, I think, or Dearman. But why?&mdash;Oh, no, by-the-bye, I think
it's Beazley."</p>

<p>"Because I could write and ask, or call. Sure to hear something."</p>

<p>"My dear, you'll hear nothing, and they'll only think you mad."
Rosalind was beginning to feel that she had made a mistake. She did
not feel so sure Sally would hear nothing. A recollection crossed
her mind of how one of the few incidents there was time for in her
short married life had been the writing of a letter by her husband
to his friend, the real Fenwick, and of much chaff therein about the
eldest of these very daughters, and her powerful rivalry to Jessie
Nairn. It came back to her now. Sally alarmed her still further.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother. I shall just get Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick to hunt up the address,
and go and call on the Beazleys." This sudden assumption of a
concrete form by the family was due to a vivid image that filled
Sally's active brain immediately of a household of parched women
presided over by a dried man who owned a wig on

<!-- Page 137 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
a stand and knew
what chaff-wax meant, which she didn't. A shop window near Lincoln's
Inn was responsible. But to Rosalind it really seemed that Sally
must have had other means of studying this family, and she was
frightened.</p>

<p>"You don't know them, kitten?"</p>

<p>"Not the least. Don't want to." This reflection suggests caution.
"Perhaps I'd better write...."</p>

<p>"Better do nothing of the sort, child. Better go to sleep...."</p>

<p>"All right." But Sally does not like quitting the subject so
abruptly, and enlarges on it a little more. She sketches out a
letter to be written to the lady who is at present a buffer-state
between the dried man and the parched women. "Dear madam," she
recites, "you may perhaps recall&mdash;or will perhaps recall&mdash;which is
right, mother?"</p>

<p>"Either, dear. Go to sleep." But just at this moment Rosalind
recollects with satisfaction that the name was neither Beazley nor
Dearman, but Tressilian Tredgold. She has been thinking of falling
back on affectation of sleep to avoid more alarms, but this makes it
needless.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I've got the name wrong," she says, with revived
wakefulness in her voice.</p>

<p>But Sally is murmuring to herself&mdash;"Perhaps recall my mother, Mrs.
Rosalind Nightingale&mdash;Rosalind in brackets&mdash;by her maiden name
of&mdash;by the same name&mdash;who married the late Mr.&nbsp;Graythorpe in
India&mdash;I say, mother...."</p>

<p>"Yes, little goose."</p>

<p>"How am I to put all that?"</p>

<p>"Go to sleep! I don't think you'll find that family very&mdash;coming. My
impression is you had much better leave it alone. What good would it
do you to find out who Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick was? And perhaps have him go away
to Australia!"</p>

<p>"Why Australia?"</p>

<p>Oh dear, what mistakes Rosalind did make! Why on earth need she name
the place she knew Gerry did go to? America would have done just as
well.</p>

<p>"Australia&mdash;New Zealand&mdash;America&mdash;anywhere!" But Sally doesn't
mind&mdash;has fallen back on her letter-sketch.</p>

<p>"Apologizing for troubling you, believe me, dear madam, yours
faithfully&mdash;or very faithfully, or truly&mdash;Rosalind Nightingale....

<!-- Page 138 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
No; I should not like Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick to go away anywhere. No more would
you. I want him here, for us. So do you!"</p>

<p>"I should be very sorry indeed for Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick to go away. We should
miss him badly. But fancy what his wife must be feeling, if he has
one. I can sympathize with her." It really was a relief to say
anything so intensely true.</p>

<p>Did the reality with which she spoke impress Sally more than the
mere words, which were no more than "common form" of conversation?
Probably, for something in them brought back her conference with the
Major on Boxing Day morning when her mother was at church. What was
that she had said to him when she was sitting on his knee improving
his whiskers?&mdash;that if she, later on, saw reason to suppose his
suspicions true, she would ask her mother point-blank. Why not? And
here she was with the same suspicions, quite, quite independent of
the Major. And see how dark it was in both rooms! One could say
anything. Besides, if her mother didn't want to answer, she could
pretend to be asleep. She wouldn't ask too loud, to give her a
chance.</p>

<p>"Mother darling, if Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick was to make you an offer, how should
you like it?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear! <i>What's</i> the child saying? What is it, Sallykin? I was
just going off."</p>

<p>Now, obviously, you can ask a lady Sally's question in the easy
course of flowing chat, but you can't drag her from the golden gates
of sleep to ask it. It gets too official. So Sally backed out, and
said she had said nothing, which wasn't the case. The excessive
readiness with which her mother accepted the statement looks, to us,
as if she had really been awake and heard.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="subhead">HOW MILLAIS' "HUGUENOT" CAME OF A WALK IN THE BACK GARDEN. AND HOW
FENWICK VERY NEARLY KISSED SALLY</p>

<p>In spite of Colonel Lund's having been so betimes in his
forecastings about Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale and Fenwick (as we must go on
calling him for the present), still, when one day that lady came,
about six weeks after the nocturne in our last chapter, and told him
she must have his consent to a step she was contemplating before she
took it, he felt a little shock in his heart&mdash;one of those shocks
one so often feels when one hears that a thing he has anticipated
without pain, even with pleasure, is to become actual.</p>

<p>But he replied at once, "My dear! Of course!" without hearing any
particulars; and added: "You will be happier, I am sure. Why should
I refuse my consent to your marrying Fenwick? Because that's it, I
suppose?" That was it. The Major had guessed right.</p>

<p>"He asked me to marry him, last night," she said, with simple
equanimity and directness. "I told him yes, as far as my own wishes
went. But I said I wouldn't, if either you or the kitten forbade the
banns."</p>

<p>"I don't think we shall, either of us." It was a daughter's
marriage-warrant he was being asked to sign; a document seldom
signed without a heartache, more or less, for him who holds the pen.
But his <i>c&oelig;ur navr&eacute;</i> had to be concealed, for the sake of the
applicant; no wet blanket should be cast on her new happiness. He
kissed her affectionately. To him, for all her thirty-nine or forty
birthdays, she was still the young girl he had helped and shielded
in her despair, twenty years ago, he himself being then a widower,
near forty years her senior. "No, Rosa dear," continued the Major.
"As far as I can see, there can be no objection but one&mdash;<i>you</i>
know!"</p>

<p>"<i>The</i> one?"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 140 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Yes. It is all a <i>terra incognita</i>. He <i>may</i> have a wife elsewhere,
seeking for him. Who can tell?"</p>

<p>"It is a risk to be run. But I am prepared to run it"&mdash;she was going
to add "for his sake," but remembered that her real meaning for
these words would be, "for the sake of the man I wronged," and that
the Major knew nothing of Fenwick's identity. She had not been able
to persuade herself to make even her old friend her confidant.
Danger lay that way. She <i>knew</i> silence would be safe against
anything but Fenwick's own memory.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a risk, no doubt," the Major said. "But I am like him. I
cannot conceive a man forgetting that he had a wife. It seems an
impossibility. He has talked about you to me, you know."</p>

<p>"In connexion with his intention about me?"</p>

<p>"Almost. Not quite definitely, but almost. He knew I understood what
he meant. It seemed to me he was fidgeting more about his having so
little to offer in the way of worldly goods than about any possible
wife in the clouds."</p>

<p>"Dear fellow! Just fancy! Why, those people in the City would take
him into partnership to-morrow if he had a little capital to bring
in. They told him so themselves."</p>

<p>"And you would finance him? Is that the idea? Well, I suppose as I'm
your trustee, if the money was all lost, I should have to make it
up, so it wouldn't matter."</p>

<p>"Oh, Major dear! is <i>that</i> what being a trustee means?"</p>

<p>"Of course, my dear Rosa! What did you think it meant?"</p>

<p>"Do you know, I don't know what I <i>did</i> think; at least, I thought
it would be very nice if you were my trustee."</p>

<p>The conversation has gone off on a siding, but the Major shunts the
train back. "That was what you and little fiddle-stick's-end were
talking about till three in the morning, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Major dear, did you hear us? And we kept you awake? What a
<i>shame</i>!"</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>For on the previous evening, Sally being out musicking and expected
home late, Fenwick and Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale had gone out in the
back-garden to enjoy the sweet air of that rare phenomenon&mdash;a really
fine spring night in England&mdash;leaving the Major indoors

<!-- Page 141 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
because of
his bronchial tubes. The late seventies shrink from night air, even
when one means to be a healthy octogenarian. Also, they go away to
bed, secretively, when no one is looking&mdash;at least, the Major did in
this case. Of course, he was staying the night, as usual.</p>

<p>So, in the interim between the Major's good-night and Sally's
cab-wheels, this elderly couple of lovers (as they would have worded
their own description) had the summer night to themselves. As the
Major closed his bedroom window, he saw, before drawing down the
blind, that the two were walking slowly up and down the gravel path,
talking earnestly. No impression of mature years came to the Major
from that gravel path. A well-made, handsome man, with a bush of
brown hair and a Raleigh beard, and a graceful woman suggesting her
beauty through the clear moonlight&mdash;that was the implication of as
much as he could see, as he drew the inference a word of soliloquy
hinted at, "Not Millais' Huguenot, so far!" But he evidently
expected that grouping very soon. Only he was too sleepy to watch
for it, and went to bed. Besides, would it have been honourable?</p>

<p>"It's no use, Fenwick," she said to him in the garden, "trying to
keep off the forbidden subject, so I won't try."</p>

<p>"It's not forbidden by me. Nothing could be, that <i>you</i> would like
to say."</p>

<p>Was that, she thought, only what so many men say every day to so
many women, and mean so little by? Or was it more? She could not be
sure yet. She glanced at him as they turned at the path-end, and her
misgivings all but vanished, so serious and resolved was his quiet
face in the moonlight. She was half-minded to say to him, "Do you
mean that you love me, Fenwick?" But, then, was it safe to presume
on the peculiarity of her position, of which he, remember, knew
absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>For with her it was not as with another woman, who expects what is
briefly called "an offer." In <i>her</i> case, the man beside her was her
husband, to whose exorcism of her love from his life her heart had
never assented. While, in his eyes, she differed in no way in her
relation to him from any woman, to whom a man, placed as he was,
longs to say that she is what he wants most of all mortal things,
but stickles in the telling of it, from sheer cowardice; who dares
not risk the loss of what share he has in her

<!-- Page 142 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
in the attempt to get
the whole. <i>She</i> grasped the whole position, <i>he</i> only part of it.</p>

<p>"I am glad it is so," she decided to say. "Because each time I see
you, I want to ask if nothing has come back&mdash;no trace of memory?"</p>

<p>"Nothing! It is all gone. Nothing comes back."</p>

<p>"Do you remember that about the tennis-court? Did it go any further,
or die out completely?"</p>

<p>He stopped a moment in his walk, and flicked the ash from his cigar;
then, after a moment's thought, replied:</p>

<p>"I am not sure. It seemed to get mixed with my name&mdash;on my arm. I
think it was only because tennis and Fenwick are a little alike."
His companion thought how near the edge of a volcano both were, and
resolved to try a crucial experiment. Better an eruption, after all,
or a plunge in the crater, than a life of incessant doubt.</p>

<p>"You remembered the name Algernon clearly?"</p>

<p>"Not <i>clearly</i>. But it was the only name with an 'A' that felt
right. Unless it was Arthur, but I'm sure my name never was Arthur!"</p>

<p>"Sally thought it was hypnotic suggestion&mdash;thought I had laid an
unfair stress upon it. I easily might have."</p>

<p>"Why? Did you know an Algernon?"</p>

<p>"My husband's name was Algernon." She herself wondered how any voice
that spoke so near a heart that beat as hers did at this moment
could keep its secret. Yet it betrayed nothing, and so supreme was
her self-control that she could say to herself, even while she knew
she would pay for this effort later, that the pallor of her face
would betray nothing either; he would put that down to the
moonlight. She <i>was</i> a strong woman. For she went steadily on, to
convince herself of her own self-command: "I knew him very little by
that name, though. I always called him Gerry."</p>

<p>He merely repeated the name thrice, but it gave her a moment of keen
apprehension. Any stirring of memory over it might be the thin end
of a very big wedge. But if there was any, it was an end so thin
that it broke off. Fenwick looked round at her.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said, "I rather favour the hypnotic suggestion
theory. For the moment you said the name Gerry, I fancied I

<!-- Page 143 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
too
knew it as the short for Algernon. Now, that's absurd! No two people
ever made Gerry out of Algernon. It's always Algy."</p>

<p>"Always. Certainly, it would be odd."</p>

<p>"I am rather inclined to think," said Fenwick, after a short
silence, "that I can understand how it happened. Only then, perhaps,
my name may not be Algernon at all. And here I have been using it,
signing with it, and so on."</p>

<p>"What do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Well, I suspect this. I suspect that you did lay some kind of
stress, naturally, on your husband's name, and also on its
abbreviation. It affected me somehow with a sense of familiarity."</p>

<p>"Is it so <i>very</i> improbable that you were familiar with the name
Gerry too? It might be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anything might be. But surely we almost know that two accidental
adoptions of Gerry as a short for Algernon would not come across
each other by chance, as yours and mine have done."</p>

<p>"What is 'almost knowing'? But tell me this. When I call you
Gerry&mdash;Gerry ... there!&mdash;does the association or impression repeat
itself?" She repeated the name once and again, to try. There was a
good deal of nettle-grasping in all this. Also a wish to clinch
matters, to drive the sword to the hilt; to put an end, once and for
all, to the state of tension she lived in. For surely, if anything
could prove his memory was really gone, it would be this. That she
should call him by his name of twenty years ago&mdash;should utter it to
him, as she could not help doing, in the tone in which she spoke to
him then, and that her doing so should arouse no memory of the
past&mdash;surely this would show, if anything could show it, that that
past had been finally erased from the scroll of his life. She had a
moment only of suspense after speaking, and then, as his voice came
in answer, she breathed again freely. Nothing could have shown a
more complete unconsciousness than his reply, after another moment
of reflection:</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale, that convinces me that the name
Algernon <i>was</i> produced by your way of saying it. It <i>was</i> hypnotic
suggestion! I assure you that, however strange you may think it,
every time you repeat the name Gerry, it seems more familiar to me.
If you said it often enough, I have no doubt I should soon be
believing in the diminutive as devoutly as

<!-- Page 144 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
I believe in the name
itself. Because I am quite convinced of Algernon Fenwick.
Continually signing <i>per-pro</i>'s has driven it home." He didn't seem
quite in earnest over his conviction, though&mdash;seemed to laugh a
little about it.</p>

<p>But a sadder tone came into his voice after an interval in which his
companion, frightened at her own temerity, resolved that she would
not call him Gerry again. It was sailing too near the wind. She was
glad he went back from this side-channel of their talk to the main
subject.</p>

<p>"No, I have no hope of getting to the past through my own mind. I
feel it is silence. And that being so, I should be sorry that any
illumination should come to me out of the past, throwing light on
records my mind could not read&mdash;I mean, any proof positive of what
my crippled memory could not confirm. I would rather remain quite in
the dark&mdash;unless, indeed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?"</p>

<p>"Unless the well-being of some others, forgotten with my forgotten
world, is involved in&mdash;dependent on&mdash;my return to it. That would be
shocking&mdash;the hungry nestlings in the deserted nest. But I am so
convinced that I have only forgotten a restless life of rapid
change&mdash;that I <i>could</i> not forget love and home, if I ever had
them&mdash;that my misgivings about this are misgivings of the reason
only, not of the heart. Do you understand me?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. At least, I think so. Go on."</p>

<p>"I cannot help thinking, too, that a sense of a strong link with a
forgotten yesterday would survive the complete effacement of all its
details in the form of a wish to return to it. I have none. My
to-day is too happy for me to wish to go back to that yesterday,
even if I could, without a wrench. I feel a sort of shame in saying
I should be sorry to return to it. It seems a sort of ... a sort of
disloyalty to the unknown."</p>

<p>"You might long to be back, if you could know. Think if you could
see before you now, and recognise the woman who was once your wife."
There was nettle-grasping in this.</p>

<p>"It is a mere abstract idea," he replied, "unaccompanied by any
image of an individual. I perceive that it is dutiful to recognise
the fact that I should welcome her <i>if</i> she appeared as a reality.
But it is a large <i>if</i>. I am content to go on without an
hypothesis&mdash;that is really all she is now. And my belief that, if

<!-- Page 145 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
she had ever existed, I should not be <i>able</i> to disbelieve in her,
underlies my acceptance of her in that character."</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale laughed. "We are mighty metaphysical," said she.
"Wouldn't it depend entirely on what she was like, when all's said
and done? I believe I'm right. We women are more practical than men,
after all."</p>

<p>"You make game of my metaphysics, as you call them. Well, I'll drop
the metaphysics and speak the honest truth." He stopped and faced
round towards her, standing on the garden path. "Only, you must make
me one promise."</p>

<p>She stopped also, and stood looking full at him.</p>

<p>"What promise?"</p>

<p>"If I tell you all I think in my heart, you will not allow it to
come between me and you, to undermine the only strong friendship I
have in the world, the only one I know of."</p>

<p>"It shall make no difference between us. You may trust me."</p>

<p>They turned and walked again slowly, once up and down. Then
Fenwick's voice, when he next spoke, had an added earnestness, a
growing tension, with an echo in it, for her, of the years gone
by&mdash;a ring of his young enthusiasm, of his passionate outburst in
the lawn-tennis garden twenty years ago. He made no more ado of what
he had to say.</p>

<p>"I can form no image in my mind, try how I may, of any woman for
whose sake I would give up one hour of the precious privilege I now
enjoy. I have no right to&mdash;to assess it, to make a definition of it.
But I <i>have</i> it now. I could not resume my place as the husband of a
now unknown wife&mdash;you know what I mean&mdash;and not lose the privilege
of being near <i>you</i>. It may be&mdash;it is conceivable, I mean; no
more&mdash;that a revelation to me of myself, a light thrown on what I
am, would bring me what would palliate the wrench of losing what I
have of you. It <i>may</i> be so&mdash;it <i>may</i> be! All I know is&mdash;all I can
say is&mdash;that I can now <i>imagine</i> nothing, no treasure of love of
wife or daughter, that would be a make-weight for what I should lose
if I had to part from you." He paused a moment, as though he thought
he was going beyond his rights of speech, then added more quietly:
"No; I can imagine <i>no</i> hypothetical wife. And as for my
hypothetical daughter, I find I am always utilising Sally for her."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 146 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale murmured in an undertone the word "Sallykin," as
she so often did when her daughter was mentioned, with that sort of
caress in her voice. This time it was caught by a sort of gasp, and
she remained silent. What Sally <i>was</i> had crossed her mind&mdash;the
strange relation in which she stood to Fenwick, born in <i>his</i>
wedlock, but no daughter of his. And there he was, as fond of the
child as he could be.</p>

<p>Fenwick may have half misunderstood something in her manner, for
when he spoke again his words had a certain aspect of recoil from
what he had said, at least of consideration of it in some new light.</p>

<p>"When I speak to you as freely as this, remember the nature of the
claim I have to do so&mdash;the only apology I can make for taking an
exceptional licence."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean I do not count myself as a man&mdash;only a sort of inexplicable
waif, a kind of cancelled man. A man without a past is like a child,
or an idiot from birth, suddenly endowed with faculties."</p>

<p>"What nonsense, Fenwick! You have brooded and speculated over your
condition until you have become morbid. Do now, as Sally would say,
chuck the metaphysics."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I was getting too sententious over it. I'm sorry, and
please I won't do so any more."</p>

<p>"Don't then. And now you'll see what will happen. You will remember
everything quite suddenly. It will all come back in a flash, and oh,
how glad you will be! And think of the joy of your wife and
children!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and suppose all the while I am hating them for dragging me
away from you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From me and Sally?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't going to say Sally, but I don't want to keep her out. You
and Sally, if you like. All I know is, if their reappearance were to
bring with it a pleasure I cannot imagine&mdash;because I cannot imagine
<i>them</i>&mdash;it would cut across my life, as it is now, in a way that
would drive me <i>mad</i>. Indeed it would. How could I say to myself&mdash;as
I say now, as I dare to say to you, knowing what I am&mdash;that to be
here with you now is the greatest happiness of which I am capable."</p>

<div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"All that would change if you recovered them."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;maybe! But I shrink from it; I shrink from <i>them</i>! They
are strangers&mdash;nonentities. You are&mdash;you are&mdash;oh, it's no use&mdash;&mdash;"
He stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"What am I?"</p>

<p>"It's no use beating about the bush. You are the centre of my life
as it is, you are what I&mdash;all that is left of me&mdash;love best in the
world! I cannot <i>now</i> conceive the possibility of anything but
hatred for what might come between us, for what might sever the
existing link, whatever it may be&mdash;I care little what it is called,
so long as I may keep it unbroken...."</p>

<p>"And I care nothing!" It was her eyes meeting his that stopped him.
He could read the meaning of her words in them before they were
spoken. Then he replied in a voice less firm than before:</p>

<p>"Dare we&mdash;knowing what I am, knowing what may come suddenly, any
hour of the day, out of the unknown&mdash;<i>dare</i> we call it love?"
Perhaps in Fenwick's mind at this moment the predominant feeling was
terror of the consequences to her that marriage with him might
betray her into. It was much stronger than any misgiving (although a
little remained) of her feelings toward himself.</p>

<p>"What else can we call it? It is a good old word." She said this
quite calmly, with a very happy face one could see the flush of
pleasure and success on even in the moonlight, and there was no
reluctance, no shrinking in her, from her share of the outcome the
Major had not waited to see. "Millais' Huguenot" was complete.
Rosalind Graythorpe, or Palliser, stood there again with her
husband's arm round her&mdash;her husband of twenty years ago! And in
that fact was the keynote of what there was of unusual&mdash;of
unconventional, one might almost phrase it&mdash;in her way of receiving
and requiting his declaration. It hardly need be said that <i>he</i> was
unconscious of any such thing. A man whose soul is reeling with the
intoxication of a new-found happiness is not overcritical about the
exact movement of the hand that has put the cup to his lips.</p>

<p>The Huguenot arrangement might have gone on in the undisturbed
moonlight till the chill of the morning came to break it up if a
cab-wheel <i>crescendo</i> and a <i>strepitoso</i> peal at the bell had not

<!-- Page 148 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
announced Sally, who burst into the house and rushed into the
drawing-room tumultuously, to be corrected back by a serious word
from Ann, the door-opener, that Missis and Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick had stepped
out in the garden. Ann's parade of her conviction that this was <i>en
r&egrave;gle</i>, when no one said it wasn't, was suggestive in the highest
degree. Professional perjury in a law-court could not have been more
self-conscious. Probably Ann knew all about it, as well as cook.
Sally saw nothing. She was too full of great events at Ladbroke
Grove Road&mdash;the sort of events that are announced with a
preliminary, What <i>do</i> you think, N or M? And then develop the
engagement of O&nbsp;to&nbsp;P, or the jilting of Q&nbsp;by&nbsp;R.</p>

<p>There was just time for a dozen words between the components of the
Millais group in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Shall we tell Sally?" It was the Huguenot that asked the question.</p>

<p>"Not just this minute. Wait till I can think. Perhaps I'll tell her
upstairs. Now say good-bye before the chick comes, and go." And the
chick came on the scene just too late to criticise the <i>pose</i>.</p>

<p>"I say, mother!" this with the greatest <i>empressement</i> of which
humanity and youth are capable. "I've got something I <i>must</i> tell
you!"</p>

<p>"What is it, kitten?"</p>

<p>"Tishy's head-over-ears in love with the shop-boy!"</p>

<p>"Sh-sh-sh-shish! You noisy little monkey, do consider! The
neighbours will hear every word you say." So they will, probably, as
Miss Sally's voice is very penetrating, and rings musically clear in
the summer night. Her attitude is that she doesn't care if they do.</p>

<p>"Besides they're only cats! And <i>nobody</i> knows who Tishy is, or the
shop-boy. I'll come down and tell you all about it."</p>

<p>"We're coming up, darling!" You see, Sally had manifestoed down into
the garden from the landing of the stair, which was made of iron
openwork you knocked flower-pots down and broke, and you have had to
have a new one&mdash;that, at least, is how Ann put it. On the stair-top
Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale stems the torrent of her daughter's revelation
because it's so late and Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick must get away.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 149 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"You must tell him all about it another time."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether it's any concern of his."</p>

<p>"Taken scrupulous, are we, all of a sudden?" says Fenwick, laughing.
"That cock won't fight, Miss Pussy! You'll have to tell me all about
it when I come to-morrow. Good-night, Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale." A sort of
humorous formality in his voice makes Sally look from one to the
other, but it leads to nothing. Sally goes to see Fenwick depart,
and her mother goes upstairs with a candle. In a minute or so Sally
pelts up the stairs, leaving Ann and the cook to thumbscrew on the
shutter-panels of the street door, and make sure that
housebreaker-baffling bells are susceptible.</p>

<p>"Do you know, mamma, I really <i>did</i> think&mdash;what do you think I
thought?"</p>

<p>"What, darling?"</p>

<p>"I thought Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick was going to kiss me!" In fact, Fenwick had
only just remembered in time that family privileges must stand over
till after the revelation.</p>

<p>"Should you have minded if he had?"</p>

<p>"<i>Not a bit!</i> Why should <i>anybody</i> mind Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick kissing them?
You wouldn't yourself&mdash;you know you wouldn't! Come now, mother!"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't distress myself, poppet!" But words are mere wind; the
manner of them is everything, and the foreground of her mother's
manner suggests a background to Sally. She has smelt a rat, and
suddenly fixes her eyes on a tell-tale countenance fraught with
mysterious reserves.</p>

<p>"Mother, you <i>are</i> going to marry Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick!" No change of type
could do justice to the emphasis with which Sally goes straight to
the point. Italics throughout would be weak. Her mother smiles as
she fondles her daughter's excited face.</p>

<p>"I am, darling. So you may kiss him yourself when he comes to-morrow
evening."</p>

<p>And Tishy's passion for the shop-boy had to stand over. But, as the
Major had said, the mother and daughter talked till three in the
morning&mdash;well, past two, anyhow!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="subhead">CONCERNING DR. VEREKER AND HIS MAMMA, WHO HAD KNOWN IT ALL ALONG.
HOW SALLY LUNCHED WITH THE SALES WILSONS, AND GOT SPECULATING ABOUT
HER FATHER. HOW TISHY LET OUT ABOUT MAJOR ROPER. HOW THERE WAS A
WEDDING</p>

<p>The segment of a circle of Society that did duty for a sphere, in
the case of Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale and Sally, was collectively surprised
when it heard of the intended marriage of the former, having settled
in its own mind that the latter was the magnet to Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick's
lodestone. But each several individual that composed it had, it
seemed, foreseen exactly what was going to happen, and had predicted
it in language that could only have been wilfully mistaken by
persons interested in proving that the speaker was not a prophet.
Exceptional insight had been epidemic. The only wonder was (to the
individual speaker) that Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale had remained single so
long, and the only other wonder was that none of the other cases had
seen it. They had evidently only taken seership mildly.</p>

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Vereker had a good opportunity of studying omniscience of a
malignant type in the very well marked case of his own mother. You
may remember Sally's denunciation of her as an old hen that came
wobbling down on you. When her son (in the simplicity of his heart)
announced to her as a great and curious piece of news that Mr.
Fenwick was going to marry Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale, she did not even look
up from her knitting to reply: "What did I say to you, Conny?" For
his name was Conrad, as Sally had reported. His discretion was not
on the alert on this occasion, for he incautiously asked, "When?"</p>

<p>The good lady laid down her knitting on her knees, and folded her
hands, interlacing her fingers, which were fat, as far as they would
go, and leaning back with closed eyes&mdash;eyes intended to remain
closed during anticipated patience.</p>

<p>"Fancy asking me that!" said she.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 151 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;hang it!&mdash;<i>when?</i>"</p>

<p>"Do not use profane language, Conrad, in your mother's presence. Can
you really ask me, 'When?' Try and recollect!"</p>

<p>Conrad appeared to consider; but as he had to contend with the
problem of finding out when a thing had been said, the only clue to
the nature of which was the date of its utterance, it was no great
wonder that his cogitations ended in a shake of the head subdivided
into its elements&mdash;shakes taken a brace at a time&mdash;and an expression
of face as of one who whistles <i>sotto voce</i>. His questioner must
have been looking between her eyelids, which wasn't playing fair;
for she indicted him on the spot, and pushed him, as it were, into
the dock.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i>, I suppose, means that I speak untruth. Very well, my dear!"
Resignation set in.</p>

<p>"Come, mother, I say, now! Be a reasonable maternal parent. When did
I say anybody spoke untruth?"</p>

<p>"My dear, you <i>said</i> nothing. But if your father could have heard
what you did <i>not</i> say, you know perfectly well, my dear Conrad,
what he would have <i>thought</i>. Was he likely to sit by and hear me
insulted? Did he ever do so?"</p>

<p>The doctor was writing letters at a desk-table that he used for
miscellaneous correspondence as much as possible, in order that this
very same mother of his should be left alone as little as possible.
He ended a responsible letter, and directed it, and made it a thing
of the past with a stamp on it in a little basket on the hall-table
outside. Then he came back to his mother, and bestowed on her the
kiss, or peck, of peace. It always made him uncomfortable when he
had to go away to the hospital under the shadow of dissension at
home.</p>

<p>"Well, mother dear, what was it you really did say about the Fenwick
engagement?"</p>

<p>"It would be more proper, my dear, to speak of it as the Nightingale
engagement. You will say it is a matter of form, but...."</p>

<p>"All right. The Nightingale engagement...."</p>

<p>"My dear! So abrupt! To your mother!"</p>

<p>"Well, dear mammy, what was it, really now?" This cajolery took
effect, and the Widow Vereker's soul softened. She resumed her
knitting.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 152 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"If you don't remember what it was, dear, it doesn't matter." The
doctor saw that nothing short of complete concession would procure a
tranquil sea.</p>

<p>"Of course, I remember perfectly well," he said mendaciously. He
knew that, left alone, his mother would supply a summary of what he
remembered. She did so, with a bound.</p>

<p>"I said, my dear (and I am glad you recollect it, Conrad)&mdash;I said
from the very first, when Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick was living at Krakatoa&mdash;(it
was all <i>quite</i> right, my dear. Do you think I don't know? A
grown-up daughter and two servants!)&mdash;I said that any one with eyes
in their head could see. And has it turned out exactly as I
expected, or has it not?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Very well, dear. I'm glad you say so. Now, don't contradict me
another time."</p>

<p>The close observer of the actual (whom we lay claim to be) has
occasionally to report the apparently impossible. We do not suppose
we shall be believed when we say that Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker added: "Besides,
there was the Major."</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Professor Sales Wilson, L&aelig;titia's father, was <i>the</i> Professor Sales
Wilson. Only, if you had seen that eminent scholar when he got
outside his library by accident and wanted to get back, you wouldn't
have thought he was <i>the</i> anybody, and would probably have likened
him to a disestablished hermit-crab&mdash;in respect, that is, of such a
one's desire to disappear into his shell, and that respect only. For
no hermit-crab would ever cause an acquaintance to wonder why he
should shave at all if he could do it no better than that; nor what
he was talking to himself about so frequently; nor whether he
polished his spectacles so long at a time to give the deep groove
they were making across his nose a chance of filling up; nor whether
he would be less bald if he rubbed his head less; nor what he had
really got inside that overpowering phrenology of brow, and behind
that aspect of chronic concentration. But about the retiring habits
of both there could be no doubt.</p>

<p>He lived in his library, attired by nature in a dressing-gown and
skull-cap. But from its secret recesses he issued manifestoes which
shook classical Europe. He corrected versions, excerpted passages

<!-- Page 153 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>,
disallowed authenticities, ascribed works to their true authors, and
exposed the pretensions of sciolists with a vigour which ought to
have finally dispersed that unhallowed class. Only it didn't,
because they are a class incapable of shame, and will go on madly,
even when they have been proved to be <i>mere</i>, beyond the shadow of a
doubt. Perhaps they had secret information about the domestic
circumstances of their destroyer, and didn't care. If Yamen had had
private means of knowing that Vishnu was on uncomfortable terms with
his wife, a corrected version of the whole Hindu mythology might
have been necessary.</p>

<p>However, so far as can be conjectured, the image the world formed of
the Professor was a sort of aggregate of Dr.&nbsp;Johnson, Bentley,
Grotius, Mezzofanti, and a slight touch of, say Conington, to bring
him well up to date. But so much of the first that whenever the
<i>raconteur</i> repeated one of the Professor's moderately bon-mots, he
always put "sir" in&mdash;as, for instance, "A punster, sir, is a man who
demoralises two meanings in one word;" or, "Should you call that
fast life, sir? <i>I</i> should call it slow death." The <i>raconteur</i> was
rather given to making use of him, and assigning to him <i>mots</i> which
were not at all <i>bons</i>, because they only had the "sir" in them, and
were otherwise meaningless. He was distressed, not without reason,
when he heard that he had said to Max M&uuml;ller, or some one of that
calibre, "There is no such thing, sir, as the English language!" But
he very seldom heard anything about himself, or any one else; as he
passed his life, as aforesaid, in his library, buried in the
Ph&oelig;nician Dictionary he hoped he might live to bring out. He had
begun the fourth letter; but <i>we</i> don't know the Ph&oelig;nician
alphabet. Perhaps it has only four letters in it.</p>

<p>He came out of the library for meals, of course. But he took very
little notice of anything that passed at the family board, and read
nearly the whole time, occasionally saying something forcible to
himself. Indeed, he never conversed with his family unless deprived
of his book. This occurred on the occasion when Sally carried the
momentous news of her mother's intended marriage to Ladbroke Grove
Road, the second day after they had talked till two in the morning.
Matrimony was canvassed and discussed in all its aspects, and the
particular case riddled and sifted, and elucidated from every point
of the compass, without the

<!-- Page 154 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Professor being the least aware that
anything unusual was afoot, until Grotefend got in the mayonnaise
sauce.</p>

<p>"Take your master's book away, Jenkins," said the lady of the house.
And Jenkins, the tender-hearted parlourmaid, allowed master to keep
hold just to the end of the sentence. "Take it away, as I told you,
and wipe that sauce off!"</p>

<p>Sally did so want to box that woman's ears&mdash;at least, she said so
after. She was a great horny, overbearing woman, was Mrs.&nbsp;Sales
Wilson, and Sally was frightened lest L&aelig;titia should grow like her.
Only, Tishy's teeth never <i>could</i> get as big as that! Nor wiggle.</p>

<p>The Professor, being deprived of his volume, seemed to awake
compulsorily, and come out into a cold, unlearned world. But he
smiled amiably, and rubbed his hands round themselves rhythmically.</p>

<p>"Well, then!" said he. "Say it all again."</p>

<p>"Say what, papa?"</p>

<p>"All the chatter, of course."</p>

<p>"What for, papa?"</p>

<p>"For me to hear. Off we go! <i>Who's</i> going to be married?"</p>

<p>"You see, he was listening all the time. <i>I</i> shouldn't tell him, if
I were you. Your father is really unendurable. And he gets worse."
Thus the lady of the house.</p>

<p>"What does your mother say?" There is a shade of asperity in the
Professor's voice.</p>

<p>"Says you were listening all the time, papa. So you were!" This is
from L&aelig;titia's younger sister, Theeny. Her name was Athene. Her
brother Egerton called her "Gallows Athene"&mdash;an offensive perversion
of the name of the lady she was called after. Her mother had
carefully taught all her children contempt for their father from
earliest childhood. But toleration of his weaknesses&mdash;etymology, and
so on&mdash;had taken root in spite of her motherly care, and the
Professor was on very good terms with his offspring. He negatived
Theeny amiably.</p>

<p>"No, my dear, I was like Mrs.&nbsp;Cluppins. The voices were loud, and
forced themselves upon my ear. But as you all spoke at once, I have
no idea what anybody said. My question was conjectural&mdash;purely
conjectural. <i>Is</i> anybody going to marry anybody? <i>I</i> don't know."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 155 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"What is your father talking about over there? <i>Is</i> he going to help
that tongue or not? Ask him." For a peculiarity in this family was
that the two heads of it always spoke to one another through an
agent. So clearly was this understood that direct speech between
them, on its rare occasions, was always ascribed by distant hearers
to an outbreak of hostilities. If either speaker had addressed the
other by name, the advent of the Sergeant-at-Arms would have been
the next thing looked for. On this occasion L&aelig;titia's literal
transmission of "<i>Are</i> you going to help the tongue or not, papa?"
recalled his wandering mind to his responsibilities. Sally's
liver-wing&mdash;she was the visitor&mdash;was pleading at his elbow for its
complement of tongue.</p>

<p>But soon a four-inch space intervened between the lonely tongue-tip
on the dish and what had once been, in military language, its base
of operations. Everybody that took tongue had got tongue.</p>

<p>"Well, then, how about who's married whom?" Thus the Professor,
resuming his hand-rubbing, and neglecting the leg of a fowl.</p>

<p>"Make your father eat his lunch, L&aelig;titia. We <i>cannot</i> be late again
this afternoon." Whereon every one ate too fast; and Sally felt very
glad the Professor had given her such a big slice of tongue, as she
knew she wouldn't have the courage to have a second supply, if
offered, much less ask for it.</p>

<p>"Do you hear, papa? I'm to make you eat your lunch," says L&aelig;titia;
and her mother murmurs "That's right; make him," as though he were
an anaconda in the snake-house, and her daughter a keeper who could
go inside the cage. L&aelig;titia then adds briefly that Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale
is going to marry Fenwick.</p>

<p>"Ha! Mercy on us!" says the Professor quite vaguely, and, even more
so, adds: "Chicken&mdash;chicken&mdash;chicken&mdash;chicken&mdash;chicken!" Though what
he says next is more intelligible, it is unfortunate and ill-chosen:
"And who <i>is</i> Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale?"</p>

<p>The sphinx is mobility itself compared with Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson's intense
preservation of her <i>status quo</i>. The import of which is that the
Professor's blunders are things of everyday occurrence&mdash;every
minute, rather. She merely says to Europe, "You see," and leaves
that continent to deal with the position. Sally, who always gets
impatient with the Wilson family, except the Professor himself

<!-- Page 156 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and
L&aelig;titia&mdash;though <i>she</i> is trying sometimes&mdash;now ignores Europe, and
gets the offender into order on her own account.</p>

<p>"Why, Professor dear, don't you know Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale's my mother?
I'm Sally Nightingale, you know!"</p>

<p>"I'm not at all sure that I did, my dear. I think I thought you were
Sally Something-else. My mind is very absent sometimes. You must
forgive me. Sally Nightingale! To be sure!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Professor dear!" But the Professor still looks vexed at
his blunder. So Sally says in confirmation, "I've forgiven you.
Shake hands!" And doesn't make matters much better, for her action
seems unaccountable to the absent-minded one, who says, "Why?"
first, and then, "Oh, ah, yes&mdash;I see. Shake hands, certainly!" On
which the Sphinx, at the far end of the table, wondered whether the
ancient Ph&oelig;nicians were rude, under her breath.</p>

<p>"I'm so absent, Sally Nightingale, that I didn't even know your
father wasn't living." L&aelig;titia looks uncomfortable, and when Sally
merely says, "I never saw my father," thinks to herself what a very
discreet girl Sally is. Naturally she supposes Sally to be a wise
enough child to know something about her own father. But the Wilson
family were not completely in the dark about an unsatisfactory
"something queer" in Sally's extraction; so that she credits that
unconscious young person with having steered herself skilfully out
of shoal-waters; but she is not sure whether to class her
achievement as intrepidity or cheek. She is wanted in the
intelligence department before she can decide this point.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, if you try, L&aelig;titia, you'll be able to make out whether
your father is or is not going to eat his lunch."</p>

<p>But as this appeal of necessity causes the Professor to run the risk
of choking himself before L&aelig;titia has time to formulate an inquiry,
she can fairly allow the matter to lapse, as far as she is
concerned. The dragon, her mother&mdash;for that was how Sally spoke of
the horny one&mdash;kept an eye firmly fixed on the unhappy honorary
member of most learned societies, and gave the word of command,
"Take away!" with such promptitude that Jenkins nearly carried off
the plate from under his knife and fork as he placed them on it.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 157 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
</div>

<p>A citation from the Odyssey was received in stony silence by the
Dragon, who, however, remarked to her younger daughter that it was
no use talking about Phineus and the Harpies, because they had to be
at St.&nbsp;Pancras at 3.10, or lose the train. And perhaps, if the
servants were to be called Harpies, your father would engage the
next one himself. They were trouble enough now, without that.</p>

<p>Owing to all which, the reference to Sally's father got lost sight
of; and she wasn't sorry, because Theeny, at any rate, wasn't wanted
to know anything about him, whatever L&aelig;titia and her mother knew or
suspected.</p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, Sally's declaration that she "never saw"
him was neither discretion, nor intrepidity, nor cheek. It was
simple Nature. She had always regarded her father as having been
accessory to herself before the fact; also as having been, for some
mysterious reason, unpopular&mdash;perhaps a <i>mauvais sujet</i>. But he was
Ancient History now&mdash;had joined the Ph&oelig;nicians. Why should <i>she</i>
want to know? Her attitude of uninquiring acquiescence had been
cultivated by her mother, and it is wonderful what a dominant
influence from early babyhood can do. Sally seldom spoke of this
mysterious father of hers in any other terms than those she had just
used. She had never had an opportunity of making his
acquaintance&mdash;that was all. In some way, undefined, he had not
behaved well to her mother; and naturally she sided with the latter.
Once, and once only, her mother had said to her, "Sally darling, I
don't wish to talk about your father, but to forget him. I have
forgiven him, because of you. Because&mdash;how could I have done without
you, kitten?" And thereafter, as Sally's curiosity was a feeble
force when set against the possibility that its gratification might
cause pain to her mother, she suppressed it easily.</p>

<p>But now and again little things would be said in her presence that
would set her a-thinking&mdash;little things such as what the Professor
has just said. She may easily have been abnormally sensitive on the
point&mdash;made more prone to reflection than usual&mdash;by last night's
momentous announcement. Anyhow, she resolved to talk to Tishy about
her parentage as soon as they should get back to the drawing-room,
where they were practising. All the two hours they ought to have
played in the morning Tishy would

<!-- Page 158 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
talk about nothing but Julius
Bradshaw. And look how ridiculous it all was! Because she <i>did</i> call
him "shop-boy"&mdash;you know she did&mdash;only six weeks ago. Sally didn't
see why <i>her</i> affairs shouldn't have a turn now; and although she
was quite aware that her friend wanted her to begin again where they
had left off before lunch, she held out no helping hand, but gave
the preference to her own thoughts.</p>

<p>"I suppose my father drank," said Sally to Tishy.</p>

<p>"If you don't know, dear, how should I?" said Tishy to Sally. And
that did seem plausible, and made Sally the more reflective.</p>

<p>The holly-leaves were gone now that had been conducive to thought at
Christmas in this same room when we heard the two girls count four
so often, but Sally could pull an azalea flower to pieces over her
cogitations, and did so, instead of tuning up forthwith. L&aelig;titia was
preoccupied&mdash;couldn't take an interest in other people's fathers,
nor her own for that matter. She tuned up, though, and told Sally to
look alive. But while Sally looks alive she backs into a
conversation of the forenoon, and out of the pending discussion of
Sally's paternity. Their two preoccupations pull in opposite
directions.</p>

<p>"You <i>will</i> remember not to say anything, won't you, Sally dear? Do
promise."</p>

<p>"Say anything? Oh no; <i>I</i> shan't say anything. I never do say
things. What about?"</p>

<p>"You know as well as I do, dear&mdash;about Julius Bradshaw."</p>

<p>"Of course I shan't, Tishy. Except mother; she doesn't count. I say,
Tishy!"</p>

<p>"Well, dear. Do look alive. I'm all ready."</p>

<p>"All right. Don't be in a hurry. I want to know whether you really
think my father drank."</p>

<p>"Why should I, dear? I never heard anything about him&mdash;at least, I
never heard anything myself. Mamma heard something. Only I wasn't to
repeat it. Besides, it was nothing whatever to do with drink." The
moment L&aelig;titia said this, she knew that she had lost her hold on her
only resource against cross-examination. When the difficulty of
concealing anything is thrown into the same scale with the pleasure
of telling it, the featherweights of duty and previous resolutions
kick the beam. Then you are sorry when it's too late. L&aelig;titia was,
and could see

<!-- Page 159 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
her way to nothing but obeying the direction on her
music, which was <i>attacca</i>. To her satisfaction, Sally came in
promptly in the right place, and a first movement in B sharp went
steadily through without a back-lash. There seemed a chance that
Sally hadn't caught the last remark, but, alas! it vanished.</p>

<p>"What was it, then, if it wasn't drink?" said she, exactly as if
there had been no music at all. L&aelig;titia once said of Sally that she
was a horribly direct little Turk. She was very often&mdash;in this
instance certainly.</p>

<p>"I suppose it was the usual thing." Twenty-four, of course, knew
more than nineteen, and could speak to the point of what was and
wasn't usual in matters of this kind. But if L&aelig;titia hoped that
vagueness would shake hands with delicacy and that details could be
lubricated away, she was reckoning without her Turk.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the usual thing?"</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better go on to the fugue? I don't care for the next
movement, and it's easy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not till you say what you mean by 'the usual thing.'"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, I suppose you know what half the divorce-cases are
about?"</p>

<p>"<i>Tishy!</i>"</p>

<p>"What, dear?"</p>

<p>"There was <i>no</i> divorce!"</p>

<p>"How do you know, dear?"</p>

<p>"I <i>should</i> have known of it."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"You might go on for ever that way. Now, Tishy dear, do be kind and
tell me what you heard and who said it. <i>I</i> should tell <i>you</i>. You
<i>know</i> I should." This appeal produces concession.</p>

<p>"It was old Major Roper told mamma&mdash;with blue pockets under his eyes
and red all over, creeks and wheezes when he speaks&mdash;do you know
him?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't, and I don't want to. At least, I've just seen him at a
distance. I could see he was purple. <i>Our</i> Major&mdash;Colonel Lund, you
know&mdash;says he's a horrible old gossip, and you can't rely on a word
he says. But what <i>did</i> he say?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, I oughtn't to tell you this, because I promised

<!-- Page 160 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
not. What he <i>said</i> was that your mother went out to be married to
your father in India, and the year after he got a divorce because he
was jealous of some man your mother had met on the way out."</p>

<p>"How old was I?"</p>

<p>"Gracious me, child! how should <i>I</i> know. He only said you were a
baby in arms. Of course, you must have been, if you think of it."
L&aelig;titia here feels that possible calculations may be embarrassing,
and tries to avert them. "Do let's get on to the third movement. We
shall spend all the afternoon talking."</p>

<p>"Very well, Tishy, fire away! Oh, no; it's me." And the third
movement is got under way, till we reach a <i>pizzicato</i> passage which
Sally begins playing with the bow by mistake.</p>

<p>"That's <i>pits</i>!" says the first violin, and we have to begin again
at the top of the page, and the Professor in his library wonders why
on earth those girls can't play straight on. The Ancient
Ph&oelig;nicians are fidgeted by the jerks in the music.</p>

<p>But it comes to an end in time, and then Sally begins again:</p>

<p>"I <i>know</i> that story's all nonsense now, Tishy."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because mother told me once that my father never saw me, so come
now! Because the new-bornest baby that ever was couldn't be too
small for its father to see." Sally pauses reflectively, then adds:
"Unless he was blind. And mother would have said if he'd been
blind."</p>

<p>"He couldn't have been blind, because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, Tishy, you see! You're keeping back lots of things that old
wheezy squeaker said. And you <i>ought</i> to tell me&mdash;you know you
ought. Why couldn't he?"</p>

<p>"You're in such a hurry, dear. I was going to tell you. Major Roper
said he never saw him but once, and it was out shooting tigers, and
he was the best shot for a civilian he'd ever seen. There was a
tiger was just going to lay hold of a man and carry him off when
your father shot him from two hundred yards off&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The man or the tiger? I'm on the tiger's side. I always am."</p>

<p>"The tiger, stupid! You wouldn't want your own father to aim at a
tiger and hit a man?"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 161 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Sally reflects. "I don't think I should. But, I say, Tishy, do you
mean to say that Major Roper meant to say that he was out shooting
with my father and didn't know what his name was?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. He said his name, of course. It was Palliser ... that was
right, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no; it was Graythorpe. Palliser indeed!"</p>

<p>"It was true about the tiger though, because Major Roper says he's
got the skin himself now."</p>

<p>"Only it wasn't my father that shot it. That's quite clear." Sally
was feeling greatly relieved, and showed it in the way she added:
"Now, doesn't that just show what a parcel of nonsense the whole
story is?"</p>

<p>Sally had never told her friend about her mother's name before she
took that of Nightingale. Very slight hints had sufficed to make her
reticent about Graythorpe. Colonel Lund had once said to her: "Of
course, your mother was Mrs.&nbsp;Graythorpe when she came to England;
that was before she changed her name to Nightingale, you know?" She
knew that her mother's money had come to her from a "grandfather
Nightingale," whose name had somehow accompanied it, and had been
(very properly, as it seemed to her) bestowed on herself as well as
her mother. They were part and parcel of each other obviously. In
fact, she had never more than just known of the existence of the
name Graythorpe in her family at all, and it had been imputed by her
to this unpopular father of hers, and put aside, as it were, on a
shelf with him. Even if her mother had not suggested a desire that
the name should lapse, she herself would have accepted its
extinction on her own account.</p>

<p>But now this name came out of the past as a consolation. Palliser
indeed! How could mamma have been Mrs.&nbsp;Graythorpe if her husband's
name had been Palliser? Sally was not wise enough in worldly matters
to know that divorced ladies commonly fall back on their maiden
names. And she had been kept, or left, so much in the dark that she
had taken for granted that her mother's had been Nightingale&mdash;that,
in fact, she had retaken her maiden name at her father's wish,
possibly as a censure on the misbehaviour of a husband who drank or
gambled or was otherwise reprobate. Her young mind had been
manipulated all

<!-- Page 162 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
one way&mdash;had been in contact only with its
manipulators. Had she had a sister or brother, they would have
canvassed the subject, speculated, run conclusions to earth, and
demanded enlightenment. She had none but her mother to go to, unless
it were Colonel Lund; and the painful but inevitable task of both
was to keep her in the dark about her parentage at all hazards. "If
ever," said the former to the latter, "my darling girl has a child
of her own, I may be able to tell her her mother's story." Till
then, it would be impossible.</p>

<p>Sally had had a narrow escape of knowing more about this story when
the veteran Sub-Dean qualified himself for an obituary in the
"Times," which she chanced upon and read before her mother had time
to detect and suppress it. Luckily, a reasonable economy of type had
restricted the names and designations of all the wives he had driven
tandem, and no more was said of his third than that she was
Rosalind, the widow of Paul Nightingale. So, as soon as Sally's
mother had read the text herself, she was able to say to the Major,
quite undisturbedly, that the old Sub-Dean had gone at last, leaving
thirteen children. The name Graythorpe had not crept in.</p>

<p>But we left Sally with a question unanswered. Didn't that show what
nonsense old Major Roper's story was? L&aelig;titia was rather glad to
assent, and get the story quashed, or at least prorogued <i>sine die</i>.</p>

<p>"It did seem rather nonsense, Sally dear. Major Roper was a stupid
old man, and evidently took more than was good for him." Intoxicants
are often of great service in conversation.</p>

<p>In this case they contributed to the reinstatement of Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw.
Dear me, it did seem so funny to Sally! Only the other day this
young man had been known to her on no other lines than as an
established fool, who came to stare at <i>her</i> out of the corners of
his dark eyes all through the morning service at St.&nbsp;Satisfax. And
now it was St.&nbsp;John's, Ladbroke Grove Road, and, what was more, he
was being tolerated as a semi-visitor at the Wilsons'&mdash;a visitor
with explanations in an undertone. This was the burden of L&aelig;titia,
as soon as she had contrived to get Sally's troublesome parent
shelved.</p>

<p>"Why mamma needs always to be in such a furious fuss to drag in his
violin, I do <i>not</i> know. As if he needed to be accounted for

<!-- Page 163 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>! Of
course, if you ask a Hottentot to evenings, you have to explain him.
But the office-staff at Cattley's (which is really one of the
largest firms in the country) are none of them Hottentots, but the
contrary.... Now I know, dear, you're going to say what's the
contrary of a Hottentot, and all the while you know perfectly well
what I mean."</p>

<p>"Cut away, Tishy! What next?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;next, don't you think it very dignified of Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw to be
<i>able</i> to be condescended to and explained in corners under people's
breaths and not to show it?"</p>

<p>"He's got to lump it, if he doesn't like it." Sally, you see, has
given up her admirer readily enough, but, as she herself afterwards
said, it's quite another pair of shoes when you're called on to give
three cheers for what's really no merit at all! What does the young
man expect?</p>

<p>"Now, that's unkind, Sally dear. You wouldn't like <i>me</i> to. Anyhow,
that's what mamma <i>does</i>. Takes ladies of a certain position or with
expectations into corners, and says she hates the expression
gentleman and lady, but <i>they</i> know what she means...."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> know. And they goozle comfortably at her, like Goody Vereker."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it make one's flesh creep to have a mother like that? I do
get to hate the very sight of shot silk and binoculars on a leg when
she goes on so. But I suppose we never shall get on together&mdash;mamma
and I."</p>

<p>"What does the Professor think about him?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;papa? Of course, papa's <i>perfectly hopeless</i>! It's the only
true thing mamma ever says&mdash;that he's <i>perfectly hopeless</i>. What do
you suppose he did that Sunday afternoon when Julius Bradshaw came
and had tea and brought the Strad&mdash;the first time, I mean?... Why,
he actually fancied he had come from the shop with a parcel, and
never found out he couldn't have when he had tea in the
drawing-room, and only suspected something when he played Rode's
'Air with Variations for Violin and Piano.' Just fancy! He wanted to
know why he shouldn't have tea when every one else did, and offered
him cake! And Sunday afternoon and a Stradivarius! <i>Do</i> say you
think my parents trying, Sally dear!"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 164 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Sally assented to everything in an absent way; but that didn't
matter as long as she did it. L&aelig;titia only wanted to talk. She
seemed, thought Sally, improved by the existing combination of
events. She had had to climb down off the high stilts about
Bradshaw, and had only worked in one or two slight <i>Grundulations</i>
(a word of Dr.&nbsp;Vereker's) into her talk this morning. Tishy wasn't a
bad fellow at all (Sally's expression), only, if she hadn't been
taught to strut, she wouldn't have been any the worse. It was all
that overpowering mother of hers!</p>

<p>Before she parted with her friend that afternoon Sally had a sudden
access of Turkish directness:</p>

<p>"Tishy dear, <i>are</i> you going to accept Julius Bradshaw if he asks
you, or <i>not</i>?"</p>

<p>"Well, dear, you know we must look at it from the point of view of
what he would have been if it hadn't been for that unfortunate
nervous system of his. The poor fellow couldn't help it."</p>

<p>"But are you, or not? That's what <i>I</i> want an answer to."</p>

<p>"Sally dear! Really&mdash;you're just like so much dynamite. What would
you do yourself if you were me? I ask you."</p>

<p>"I should do exactly whatever you settle to do if I were you. It
stands to reason. But what's it going to be? That's the point."</p>

<p>"He hasn't proposed yet."</p>

<p>"That has nothing whatever to do with it. What you've got to do is
to make&mdash;up&mdash;your&mdash;mind." These last four words are very <i>staccato</i>
indeed. Tishy recovers a dignity she has rather been allowing to
lapse.</p>

<p>"By the time you're my age, Sally dear, you'll see there are ways
and ways of looking at things. Everything can't be wrapped up in a
nutshell. We're not Ancient Ph&oelig;nicians nowadays, whatever papa
may say. But you're a dear, impulsive little puss."</p>

<p>The protest was feeble in form and substance, and quite unworthy of
Miss Sales Wilson, the daughter of <i>the</i> Professor Sales Wilson. No
wonder Sally briefly responded, "Stuff and nonsense!" and presently
went home.</p>

<p>Of course, the outer circle of Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale's society (for in
this matter we are all like Regents Park) had their say about her

<!-- Page 165 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
proposed marriage. But they don't come into our story; and besides,
they had too few data for their opinions to be of any value. What a
difference it would have made if old Major Roper had met Fenwick and
recalled the face of the dead shot who, it seemed, had somehow ceded
his tiger-skin to him. But no such thing happened, nor did anything
else come about either to revive the story of the divorce or to
throw a light on the identity of Palliser and Fenwick. Eight weeks
after the latter (or the former?) had for the second time disclosed
his passion to the same woman, the couple were married at the church
of St.&nbsp;Satisfax, and, having started for the Continent the same
afternoon, found themselves, quite unreasonably happy, wandering
about in France with hardly a thought beyond the day at most, so
long as a letter came from Sally at the <i>postes-restantes</i> when
expected. And he had remembered nothing!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF A WEDDING PARTY AND AN OLD MAN'S RETROSPECT. A HOPE OF
RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE HEREAFTER. CHARLEY'S AUNT, AND PYRAMUS AND
THISBE. HOW SALLY TRIED TO PUMP THE COLONEL AND GOT HALF A BUCKETFUL</p>

<p>And thus it came about that Rosalind Palliser (<i>n&eacute;e</i> Graythorpe)
stood for the second time at the altar of matrimony with the same
bridegroom under another name. The absence of bridesmaids pronounced
and accented the fact that the bride was a widow, though, as there
were very few of the congregation of St.&nbsp;Satisfax who did not know
her as such, the announcement was hardly necessary. Discussion of
who her late husband was, or was not, had long since given way to a
belief that he was a bad lot, and that the less that was said about
him the better. If any one who was present at the wedding was still
constructing theories about his identity&mdash;whether he had divorced
his wife, was divorced himself, or was dead&mdash;certainly none of those
theories connected themselves with the present bridegroom. As for
Sally, her only feeling, over and above her ordinary curiosity about
her father, was a sort of paradoxical indignation that his intrusion
into her mother's life should have prevented her daughter figuring
as a bridesmaid. It would have been so jolly! But Sally was
perfectly well aware that widows, strong-nerved from experience,
stand in no need of official help in getting their "things" on, and
acquiesced perforce in her position of a mere unqualified daughter.</p>

<p>The Major&mdash;that is to say, Colonel Lund&mdash;stayed on after the
wedding, under a sort of imputation of guardianship necessary for
Sally&mdash;an imputation accepted by her in order that the old boy
should not feel lonesome, far more than for any advantage to
herself. She wasn't sure it did him any good though, after all, for
the wedding-party (if it could be called one, it was so

<!-- Page 167 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
small),
having decided that its afternoon had been completely broken into,
gave itself up to dissipation, and went to see "Charley's Aunt." The
old gentleman did not feel equal to this, but said if Sally told him
all about it afterwards it would be just as good, and insisted on
her going. He said he would be all right, and she kissed him and
left him reading "Harry Lorrequer," or pretending to.</p>

<p>The wedding-party seemed to have grown, thought the Major, in
contact with the theatrical world when, on its return, it filled the
summer night with sound, and made the one-eyed piebald cat who lived
at The Retreat foreclose an interview with a peevish friend
acrimoniously. Perhaps it was only because the laughter and the
jests, the good-nights mixed with echoes of "Charley's Aunt," and
reminders of appointments for the morrow, broke in so suddenly on a
long seclusion that the Major seemed to hear so many voices beyond
his expectation.</p>

<p>The time had not hung heavy on his hands though&mdash;at least, no
heavier than time always hangs on hands that wore gloves with no
fingers near upon eighty years ago. The specific gravity of the
hours varies less and less with loneliness and companionship as we
draw nearer to the last one of all&mdash;the heaviest or lightest, which
will it be? The old boy had been canvassing this point with another
old boy, a real Major, our friend Roper, at the Hurkaru Club not
long before, and, after he had read a few pages of "Harry Lorrequer"
he put his spectacles in to keep the place, and fell back into a
maze of recurrence and reflection.</p>

<p>Was he honest, or was it affectation, when he said to that pursy and
purple old warrior that if the doctor were to tell him he had but an
hour to live he should feel greatly relieved and happy? Was his
heart only pretending to laugh at the panic his old friend was
stricken with at the mere mention of the word "death"&mdash;he who had in
his time faced death a hundred times without a qualm? But then that
was military death, and was his <i>business</i>. Death the civilian, with
paragraphs in the newspapers to say "the worst" was feared, and the
fever being kept down, and the system being kept up, and smells of
carbolic acid and hourly bulletins&mdash;that was the thing he shrank
from. Why, the Major could remember old Jack Roper at Delhi, in the
Mutiny, going out in the darkness to capture those Sepoy

<!-- Page 168 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
guns&mdash;what
was that place called&mdash;Ludlow Castle?&mdash;and now!...</p>

<p>"Oh dammy, Colonel! Why, good Lard! who's dyin' or goin' to die?
Time enough to talk about dyin' when the cap fits. You take my
advice, and try a couple of Cockle's anti-bilious. My word for it,
it's liver!..." And then old Jack followed this with an
earthquake-attack of coughing that looked very much as if the cap
was going to fit. But came out of it incorrigible, and as soon as he
could speak endorsed his advice with an admonitory forefinger: "You
do as I tell you, and try 'em."</p>

<p>But the fossil, who was ten years his senior, answered his own
question to himself in the affirmative as he sat there listening to
the distant murmur of wheels on the Uxbridge Road and the music of
the cats without. Yes, he was quite honest about it. He had no
complaint to make of life, for the last twenty years at any rate.
His dear little <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i>&mdash;that was how he thought of Sally's
mother&mdash;had taken good care of that. But he had some harsh
indictments against earlier years&mdash;or rather <i>had</i> had. For he had
dismissed the culprits with a caution, and put the records on a
back-shelf.</p>

<p>He could take them down now and look at them without flinching.
After all, he was so near the end! What did it matter?</p>

<p>There they all were, the neglected chronicles, each in its corner of
his mind. Of his school-days, a record with all the blots and errors
worked into the text and made to do duty for ornaments. Not a
blemish unforgiven. It is even so with us, with you; we all forgive
our schools. Of his first uniform and his first love, two records
with a soil on each. For a chemical brother spilt sulphuric acid
over the first, and the second married a custom-house officer. Of
his first great cloud&mdash;for, if he did not quite forget his first
love, he soon got a second and even a third&mdash;a cloud that came out
of a letter that reached him in camp at Rawal Pindi, and told him
that his father, a solicitor of unblemished character till then, had
been indicted for fraudulent practices, and would have to stand his
trial for misdemeanour. Of a later letter, even worse, that told of
his acquittal on the score of insanity, and of how, when he went
back two years after

<!-- Page 169 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
on his first leave, he went to see his father
in an asylum; who did not know him and called him "my lord," and
asked him to "bring his case before the house." Then of a marriage,
like a dream now, with a wife who left him and a child that died;
and then of many colourless years of mere official routine, which
might have gone on till he fell down in harness, but for the chance
that threw in his way the daughter of an old friend in sore trouble
and alone. Not until her loneliness and want of a protector on her
voyage home suggested it did the harness come off the old horse. And
then, as we have seen, followed the happiest fourth part of his
life, as he accounted it, throughout which he had never felt so
willing to die as he had done before. Rosalind Graythorpe grew into
it as a kind of adopted daughter, and brought with her the morsel of
new humanity that had become Sally&mdash;that would be back in an hour
from "Charley's Aunt."</p>

<p>And now Rosey had found a guardian, and was provided for. It would
be no way amiss now for the Major to take advantage of death. There
is so much to be said for it when the world has left one aching!</p>

<p>His confidence that his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i> had really found a haven was no
small compliment to Fenwick. For the latter, with his strange
unknown past, had nothing but his personality to rely on; and the
verdict of the Major, after knowing him twelve months, was as
decisive on this point as if he had known him twelve years. "He may
be a bit hot-tempered and impulsive," said he to Sally. "But I
really couldn't say, if I were asked, <i>why</i> I think so. It's a mere
idea. Otherwise, it's simply impossible to help liking him." To
which Sally replied, borrowing an expression from Ann the housemaid,
that Fenwick was a cup of tea. It was metaphorical and descriptive
of invigoration.</p>

<p>But the Major's feeling that he was now at liberty to try Death
after Life, to make for port after stormy seas, had scarcely a trace
in it of dethronement or exclusion from privileges once possessed.
It was not his smallest tribute to Fenwick that he should admit the
idea to his mind at all&mdash;that he might have gained a son rather than
lost a daughter. At least, he need not reject that view of the case,
but it would not do to build on it. <i>Unberufen!</i>

<!-- Page 170 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
The Major tapped
three times on the little table where the lamp stood and "Harry
Lorrequer" lay neglected. He pulled out his watch, and decided that
they would not be very long now. He would not go to bed till he had
seen the kitten&mdash;he usually spoke of her so to her mother. He had to
disturb the kitten's cat, who was asleep on him, to get at the
watch; who, being selfish, made a grievance of it, and went away
piqued after stretching. Well, he was sorry of course, but it would
have had to come, some time. And he hadn't moved for ever so long!</p>

<p>"I wonder," half said, half thought he to himself, "I wonder who or
what he really is?... If only we could have known!... Was I right
not to urge delay?... Only Rosey was so confident.... <i>Could</i> a
woman of her age feel so sure and be misled?"</p>

<p>It was <i>her</i> certainty that had dragged his judgment along a path it
might otherwise have shrunk from. He could not know her reasons, but
he felt their force in her presence. Now she was gone, he doubted.
Had he been a fool after all?</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;well; it can't be altered now. And she would have done it
just the same whatever I said.... I suppose she was like that when
she was a girl.... I wish I had even seen that husband of hers....
So odd they should both be Algernon! Does he know, I wonder, that
the other was Algernon?" For the Major had religiously adhered to
his promise not to say anything to Fenwick about the old story. He
knew she had told it, or would tell it in her own time.</p>

<p>Then his thoughts turned to revival of how and where he found her
first, and, as it all came back to him, you could have guessed, had
you seen his face, that they had lighted on the man who was the evil
cause of all, and the woman who had abetted him. The old hand on the
table that had little more strength in it than when it wore a
hedger's glove near eighty years ago, closed with the grip of all
the force it had, and the lamp-globe rang as the tremor of his arm
shook the table.</p>

<p>"Oh, I pray God there is a hell," came audibly from as kind a heart
as ever beat. "<i>How</i> I pray God there is a hell!" Then the stress of
his anger seemed to have exhausted him, for he lay back in his
armchair with his eyes closed. In a few moments he

<!-- Page 171 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
drew a long
breath, and as he wiped the drops from his brow, said aloud to
himself: "I wish the kitten would come." He seemed happier only from
speaking of her. And then sat on and waited&mdash;waited as for a
rescue&mdash;for Sally to come and fill up the house with her voice and
her indispensable self.</p>

<p>Something of an inconsistency in the attitude of his mind may have
struck across the current of his reflections&mdash;something connected
with what this indispensable thing actually was and whence&mdash;for his
thoughts relented as the image of her came back to him. Where would
those eyes be, conspirators with the lids above them and the merry
fluctuations of the brows; where would those lips be, from which the
laughter never quite vanished, even as the ripple of the ocean's
edge tries how small it can get but never dies outright; where the
great coils of black hair that would not go inside any ordinary
oilskin swimming-cap; where the incorrigible impertinence and
flippancy be we never liked to miss a word of; where, in short,
would Sally be if she had never emerged from that black shadow in
the past?</p>

<p>Easy enough to say that, had she not done so, something else quite
as good might have been. Very likely. How can we limit the possible
to the conditional-pr&aelig;ter-pluperfect tense? But then, you see, it
wouldn't have been Sally! That's the point.</p>

<p>Sally's mother had followed such thoughts to the length of almost
forgiving the author of her troubles. But she could not forgive him
considered also as the author of her husband's. The Major could not
find any forgiveness at all, though the thought of Sally just
sufficed to modify the severity of his condemnation. Leniency
dawned.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes; I was wrong to say that. But I couldn't help it." So said
the old man to himself, but quite as though he spoke to some one
else. He paused a little, then said again: "Yes; I was wrong. But
oh, what a damned scoundrel! And <i>what</i> a woman!" Then, as though he
feared a return of his old line of thought, "I wish Sally would
come." And a dreadful half-thought came to him, "Suppose there were
a fire at the theatre, and I had to wire ... why&mdash;that would be
worst of all!"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 172 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
</div>

<p>So, almost without a pause between, he had prayed for a hell to
punish a crime, and for the safety of the treasured thing that was
its surviving record&mdash;a creature that but for that crime would never
have drawn breath.</p>

<p>His reading-lamp had burned out its young enthusiasm, and was making
up its mind to go out, only not in any hurry. It would expire with
dignity and leave a rich inheritance of stench. Meanwhile, its
decadence was marked enough to frank the Major in neglecting "Harry
Lorrequer" for the rest of the time, and also served to persuade him
that he had really been reading. Abstention from a book under
compulsion has something of the character of perusal. Gibbon could
not have collected his materials on those lines, certainly. But the
Major felt his conscience clearer from believing that he meant to go
on where he had been obliged to stop. He cancelled "Harry
Lorrequer," put him back in the bookcase to make an incident, then
began actively waiting for the return of the playgoers. Reference to
his watch at short intervals intensified their duration, added gall
to their tediousness. But so convinced was he that they "would be
here directly" that it was at least half-an-hour before he
reconsidered this insane policy and resumed his chair with a view to
keeping awake in it. He was convinced he was succeeding, had not
noticed he was dozing, when he was suddenly wrenched out of the jaws
of sleep by the merry voices of the home-comers and the loss of the
piebald cat's temper as aforesaid.</p>

<p>"Oh, Major dear, you haven't gone to bed! You will be so tired! Why
didn't you go?"</p>

<p>"I've been very happy, chick. I've been reading 'Harry Lorrequer.' I
like Charles Lever, because I read him when I was a boy. What's
o'clock?" He pulled out his watch with a pretence, easy of
detection, that he had not just done so ten minutes before. It was a
lie about "Harry Lorrequer," you see, so a little extra didn't
matter.</p>

<p>"It's awfully late!" Sally testified. "Very nearly as late as it's
possible to be. But now we're in for it, we may as well make it a
nocturnal dissipation. Ann!&mdash;don't go to bed; at least, not before
you've brought some more fresh water. This will take years to hot
up. Oh, Major, Major, why <i>didn't</i> you make

<!-- Page 173 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
yourself some toddy? I
never go out for five minutes but you don't make yourself any
toddy!"</p>

<p>"I don't want it, dear child. I've been drinking all day&mdash;however,
of course, it was a wedding...."</p>

<p>"But you must have some now, anyhow. Stop a minute, there's some one
coming up the doorsteps and Ann's fastened up.... No, it's not the
policeman. <i>I</i> know who it is. Stop a minute." And then presently
the Major hears Sally's half of an interview, apparently through a
keyhole. "I shan't open the door ... two bolts and a key and a
chain&mdash;the idea! What is it?... My pocky-anky?... Keep it, it won't
bite you ... send it to the wash!... No, really, do keep it if you
don't mind&mdash;keep it till Brahms on Thursday. Remember! Good-night."
But it isn't quite good-night, for Sally arrests departure. "Stop!
What a couple of idiots we are!... What for?&mdash;why&mdash;because you might
have stuffed it in the letter-box all along." And the incident
closes on the line indicated.</p>

<p>"It was only my medical adviser," Sally says, returning with
explanations. "Found my wipe in the cab."</p>

<p>"Dr.&nbsp;Vereker?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Dr.&nbsp;Him. Exactly! We bawled at each other through the keyhole
like Pyramus and Trilby&mdash;&mdash;" She becomes so absorbed in the details
of the toddy that she has to stand a mere emendation over until it
is ready. Then she completes: "I mean Thisbe. I wonder where they've
got to?"</p>

<p>"Pyramus and Thisbe?"</p>

<p>"No, mother and her young man.... No, I won't sit on you. I'll sit
here; down alongside&mdash;so! Then I shan't shake the toddy overboard."</p>

<p>Her white soft hand is so comforting as it lies on the Major's on
the chair-arm that he is fain to enjoy it a little, however
reproachful the clock-face may be looking. You can pretend your
toddy is too hot, almost any length of time, as long as no one else
touches the tumbler; also you can drink as slow as you like. No need
to hurry. Weddings don't come every day.</p>

<p>"Was it very funny, chick?"</p>

<p>"Oh, wasn't it! But didn't mamma look <i>lovely</i>?... I've seen it
twice before, you know." This last is by way of apology for giving
the conversation a wrench. But the Major didn't want

<!-- Page 174 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to talk over
the wedding&mdash;seemed to prefer "Charley's Aunt."</p>

<p>"He dresses up like his aunt, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;it's glorious fun! But <i>do</i> say you thought mamma looked
lovely."</p>

<p>"Of course she did. She always does. But had the others seen
'Charley's Aunt' before?"</p>

<p>"Tishy and her Bradshaw? Oh yes&mdash;at least, I suppose so."</p>

<p>"And Dr.&nbsp;Vereker?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course <i>he</i> had&mdash;twice at least. The times we saw it, mother
and I. He went too.... We-e-e-ell, there's nothing in that!" (We can
only hope again our spelling conveys the way the word <i>well</i> was
prolonged.)</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. Why should there be? What a nice fellow Vereker
is!"</p>

<p>"My medical adviser? Oh, <i>he's</i> all right. Never mind him; talk
about mother."</p>

<p>"They must be very nearly at Rheims by now." This is mere obedience
to orders on the Major's part. He feels no real interest in what he
is saying.</p>

<p>"How rum it must be!" says Sally, with grave consideration. And the
Major's "What?" evolves that "it" means marrying a second husband.</p>

<p>"Going through it all over again when you've done it once before,"
continues this young philosopher. The Major thinks of asking why it
should be rummer the second time than the first, but decides not to,
and sips his toddy, and pats the hand that is under his. In a hazy,
fossil-like way he perceives that to a young girl's mind the
"rumness" of a second husband is exactly proportionate to the
readiness of its acceptance of the first. Unity is just as intrinsic
a quality of a first husband as the colour of his eyes or hair.
Moreover, he is expected to outlive you. Above all, he is perfectly
natural and a matter of course. We discern in all this a sneaking
tribute to an idea of a hereafter; but the Major didn't go so far as
that.</p>

<p>"She looked very jolly over it," said he, retreating on
generalities. "So did he."</p>

<p>"Gaffer Fenwick? I should think so indeed! Well he might!" Then,
after a moment's consideration: "He looked like my idea of

<!-- Page 175 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Sir
Richard Grenville. It's only an idea. I forget what he did.
Elizabethan johnny."</p>

<p>"What do you call him? Gaffer Fenwick? You're a nice, respectable
young monkey! Well, he's not half a bad-looking fellow; well set
up." But none of this, though good in itself, is what Sally sat down
to talk about. A sudden change in her manner, a new earnestness,
makes the Major stop an incipient yawn he is utilising as an
exordium to a hint that we ought to go to bed, and become quite
wakeful to say: "I will tell you all I can, my child." For Sally has
thrust aside talk of the day's events, making no more of the wedding
ceremony than of "Charley's Aunt," with: "<i>Why</i> did my father and
mother part? You <i>will</i> tell me now, won't you, Major dear?"</p>

<p>Lying was necessary&mdash;inevitable. But he would minimise it. There was
always the resource of the legal fiction; all babes born in
matrimony are legally the children of their mother's husband,
<i>quand-m&ecirc;me</i>. He must make that his sheet-anchor.</p>

<p>"You know, Sallykin, your father and mother fell out before you were
born. And the first time I saw your mother&mdash;why, bless my soul, my
dear! you were quite a growing girl&mdash;yes, able to get a
staff-officer's thumb in your mouth, and bite it. Indeed, you did!
It was General Pellew; they say he's going to be made a peer." The
Major thinks he sees his way out of the fire by sinking catechism in
reminiscences. "I can recollect it all as if it were yesterday. I
said to him, 'Who's the poor pretty little mother, General?' Because
he knew your mother, and I didn't. 'Don't you know?' said he. 'She's
Mrs.&nbsp;Graythorpe.' I asked about her husband, but Pellew had known
nothing except that there was a row, and they had parted." The
Major's only fiction here was that he substituted the name
Graythorpe for Palliser. "Next time I saw her we picked up some
acquaintance, and she asked if I was a Lincolnshire Lund, because
her father always used to talk of how he went to Lund's father's,
near Crowland, when he was a boy. 'Stop a bit,' said I; 'what was
your father's name?' 'Paul Nightingale,' says she." Observe that
nothing was untrue in this, because Rosey always spoke and thought
of Paul Nightingale as her father.</p>

<p>"That was my grandfather?" Sally was intent on accumulating
facts&mdash;would save up analysis till after. The Major took advantage

<!-- Page 176 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
of a slight choke over his whiskey to mix a brief nod into it; it
was a lie&mdash;but, then, he himself couldn't have said which was nod
and which was choke; so it hardly counted. He continued, availing
himself at times of the remains of the choke to help him to slur
over difficult passages.</p>

<p>"He was the young brother of a sort of sweetheart of mine&mdash;a silly
boyish business&mdash;a sort of calf-love. She married and died. But he
was her great pet, a favourite younger brother. One keeps a
recollection of this sort of thing."&mdash;The Major makes a parade of
his powers of oblivion, and his failure to carry it out sits well
upon him.&mdash;"Of course, my romantic memories"&mdash;the Major smiles
derision of Love's young dream&mdash;"had something to do with my
interest in your mother, but I hope I should have done the same if
there had been no such thing. Well, the mere fact of your father's
behaviour to your mother...." He stopped short, with misgivings that
his policy of talking himself out of his difficulties was not such a
very safe one, after all. Here he was, getting into a fresh mess,
gratuitously!</p>

<p>"Mamma won't talk about that," says Sally, "so I suppose I'm not to
ask <i>you</i>." The Major must make a stand upon this, or the enemy will
swarm over his entrenchments. Merely looking at his watch and saying
it's time for us to be in bed will only bring a moment's respite.
There is nothing for it but decision.</p>

<p>"Sally dear, your mother does not tell you because she wishes the
whole thing buried and forgotten. Her wishes must be my wishes...."</p>

<p>He would like to stop here&mdash;to cut it short at that, at once and for
good. But the pathetic anxiety of the face from which all memories
of "Charley's Aunt" have utterly vanished is too much for his
fortitude; and, at the risk of more semi-fibs, he extenuates the
sentence.</p>

<p>"One day your mother may tell you all about it. She is the proper
person to tell it&mdash;not me. Neither do I think I know it all to
tell."</p>

<p>"You know if there was or wasn't a divorce?" The Major feels very
sorry he didn't let it alone.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you that, you inquisitive chick, if you'll promise on
honour not to ask any more questions."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 177 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>"Honour bright?"</p>

<p>"Honest Injun!"</p>

<p>"That's right. Now I'll tell you. There was no divorce, but there
was a suit for a divorce, instituted by him. He failed to make out a
case." Note that the expression "your father" was carefully
excluded. "She was absolutely blameless&mdash;to my thinking, at least.
Now that's plenty for a little girl to know. And it's high time we
were both in bed and asleep."</p>

<p>He kisses the grave, sad young face that is yearning to hear more,
but is too honourable to break its compact. "They'll be at Rheims by
now," says he, to lighten off the conversation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="subhead">SALLY'S LARK. AND HOW SHE TOOK HER MEDICAL ADVISER INTO HER
CONFIDENCE AFTER DIVINE SERVICE</p>

<p>Though Sally cried herself to sleep after her interview with her
beloved but reticent old fossil, nevertheless, when she awoke next
morning and found herself mistress of the house and the situation,
she became suddenly alive to the advantages of complete
independence. She was an optimist constitutionally; for it <i>is</i>
optimism to decide that it is "rather a lark" to breakfast by
yourself when you have just dried the tears you have been shedding
over the loss of your morning companion. Sally came to this
conclusion as she poured out her tea, after despatching his toast
and coffee to the Major in his own room. He sometimes came down to
breakfast, but such a dissipation as yesterday put it out of the
question on this particular morning.</p>

<p>The lark continued an unalloyed, unqualified lark quite to the end
of the second cup of tea, when it seemed to undergo a slight
clouding over&mdash;a something we should rather indicate by saying that
it slowed down passing through a station, than that it was modulated
into a minor key. Of course, we are handicapped in our metaphors by
an imperfect understanding of the exact force of the word "lark"
used in this connexion.</p>

<p>The day before does not come back to us during our first cup at
breakfast, whether it be tea or coffee. A happy disposition lets
what we have slept on sleep, till at least it has glanced at the
weather, and knows that it is going to be cooler, some rain. Then
memory revives, and all the chill inheritance of overnight. We pick
up the thread of our existence, and draw our finger over the last
knots, and then go on where we left off. We remember that we have to
see about this, and we mustn't be late at that, and that there's an
order got to be made out for the stores. There wasn't in Sally's
case, certainly, because it was Sunday; but there was tribulation
awaiting her as soon as she could recollect

<!-- Page 179 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
her overdue analysis of
the Major's concealed facts. She had put it off till leisure should
come; and now that she was only looking at a microcosm of the garden
seen through the window, and reflected upside down in the tea-urn,
she had surely met with leisure. Her mind went back tentatively on
the points of the old man's reminiscences, as she looked at her own
thoughtful face in the convex of the urn opposite, nursed in two
miniature hands whose elbows were already becoming unreasonably
magnified, though really they were next to nothing nearer.</p>

<p>Just to think! The Major had actually been in love when he was
young. More than once he must have been, because Sally knew he was a
widower. She touched the shiny urn with her finger, to see how
hideously it swelled in the mirror. You know what fun that is! But
she took her finger back, because it was too hot, though off the
boil.</p>

<p>There was a bluebottle between the blind and the window-pane, as
usual; if he was the same bluebottle that was there when Fenwick was
first brought into this room, he had learned nothing and forgotten
nothing, like the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i> in France. He only knew how to butt
and blunder resonantly at the glass; but he could do it as well as
ever, and he seemed to have made up his mind to persevere. Sally
listened to his monotone, and watched her image in the urn.</p>

<p>"I wish I hadn't promised not to ask more," she thought to herself.
"Anyhow, Tishy's wrong. Nobody ever was named Palliser&mdash;that's flat!
And if there was a divorce-suit ever so, <i>I</i> don't care!..." She had
to stop thinking for a moment, to make terms with the cat, who
otherwise would have got her claws in the beautiful white damask,
and ripped.</p>

<p>"Besides, if my precious father behaved so badly to mamma, how could
it be <i>her</i> fault? I don't <i>believe</i> in mother being the <i>least</i>
wrong in anything, so it's no use!" This last filled out a response
to an imaginary indictment of an officious Crown-Prosecutor. "I know
what I should like! I should like to get at that old Scroope, or
whatever his name is, and get it all out of him. I'd give him a
piece of my mind, gossipy old humbug!" It then occurred to Sally
that she was being unfair. No, she wouldn't castigate old Major
Roper for tattling, and at the same time cross-examine him for her
own purposes. It would be underhand.

<!-- Page 180 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
But it would be very easy, if
she could get at him, to make him talk about it. She rehearsed ways
and means that might be employed to that end. For instance, nothing
more natural than to recur to the legend of how she bit General
Pellew's finger; that would set him off! She recited the form of
speech to be employed. "Do you know, Major Roper, I'm told I once
bit a staff-officer's finger off," etc. Or would it be better not to
approach the matter with circumspection, but go straight to the
point&mdash;"You must have met my father, Major Roper, etc.," and then
follow on with explanations? Oh dear, how difficult it was to
settle! If only there were any one she could trust to talk to about
it! Really, Tishy was quite out of the question, even if she could
take her mind off her Bradshaw for five minutes, which she couldn't.</p>

<p>"Of course, there's Prosy, if you come to that," was the conclusion
reached at the end of a long avenue of consideration, on each side
of which referees who might have been accepted, but had been
rejected, were supposed to be left to their disappointment. "Only,
fancy making a confidant of old Prosy! Why, he'd feel your pulse and
look at your tongue, just as likely as not."</p>

<p>But Dr.&nbsp;Vereker, thus dismissed to the rejected referees, seemed not
to care for their companionship, and to be able to come back. At any
rate, Miss Sally ended up a long cogitation with, "I've a great mind
to go and talk to Prosy about it, after all! Perhaps he would be at
church."</p>

<p>Now, if this had been conversation instead of soliloquy, Sally's
constitutional frankness would have entered some protest against the
assumption that she intended to go to church as a matter of course.
As she was her only audience, and one that knew all about the
speaker already, she slurred a little over the fact that her
decision to attend church was influenced by a belief that probably
Dr.&nbsp;Vereker would be there. If she chose, she should deceive
herself, and consult nobody else. She looked at her watch, as the
open-work clock with the punctual ratchet-movement had stopped, and
was surprised to find how late she was. "Comes of weddings!" was her
comment. However, she had time to wind the clock up and set it going
when she came downstairs again ready for church.</p>

<p>St.&nbsp;Satisfax's Revd. Vicar prided himself on the appropriateness of
his sermons; so, this time, as he had yesterday united a
distinguished and beautiful widow to her second husband, he selected
for his text the parable of the widow's son. True, Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale
had no son, and her daughter wasn't dead, and there is not a hint in
the text that the widow of Nain married again, or had any intention
of doing so. On the other hand, the latter had no daughter,
presumably, and her son was alive. And as to marrying again, why,
there was the very gist and essence of the comparison, if you chose
to accept the cryptic suggestions of the Revd. Vicar, and make it
for yourself. The lesson we had to learn from this parable was
obviously that nowadays widows, however good and solvent, were
mundane, and married again; while in the City of Nain, nineteen
hundred years ago, they (being in Holy Writ) were, as it were,
Sundane, and didn't. The delicacy of the reverend suggestion to this
effect, without formal indictment of any offender, passes our powers
of description. So subtle was it that Sally felt she had nothing to
lay hold of.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the last of the group that included herself and
the doctor, and walked from St.&nbsp;Satisfax towards its atomic
elements' respective homes, had vanished down her turning&mdash;it was
the large Miss Baker, as a matter of fact&mdash;then Sally referred to
the sermon and its text, jumping straight to her own indictment of
the preacher.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't my mother marry again if she likes, Dr.
Vereker&mdash;especially Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think it possible, Miss Sally, that the parson didn't
mean anything about your mother&mdash;didn't connect her in his mind
with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With the real widow in the parable? Oh yes, he did, though! As if
mother was a real widow!"</p>

<p>Now, the doctor had heard from his own widowed mother the heads of
the gossip about the supposed divorce. He had pooh-poohed this as
mere tattle&mdash;asked for evidence, and so on. But, having heard it, it
was not to be wondered at that he put a false interpretation on
Sally's last words. They seemed to acknowledge the divorce story. He
felt very unsafe, and could only repeat them half interrogatively,
"As if Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale was

<!-- Page 182 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
a real widow?" But with the effect that
Sally immediately saw clean through him, and knew what was passing
in his mind.</p>

<p>"Oh no, Dr.&nbsp;Vereker! I wasn't thinking of <i>that</i>." She faced round
to disclaim it, turning her eyes full on the embarrassed doctor.
Then she suddenly remembered it was the very thing she had come out
to talk about, and felt ashamed. The slightest possible flush, that
framed up her smile and her eyes, made her at this moment a bad
companion for a man who was under an obligation not to fall in love
with her&mdash;for that was how the doctor thought of himself. Sally
continued: "But I wish I had been, because it would have done
instead."</p>

<p>The young man was really, at the moment, conscious of very little
beyond the girl's fascination, and his reply, "Instead of what?" was
a little mechanical.</p>

<p>"I mean instead of explaining what I wanted you to talk about
special. But when I spoke, you know, just now about a real widow, I
meant a real widow that&mdash;that <i>wids</i>&mdash;you know what I mean. Don't
laugh!"</p>

<p>"All right, Miss Sally. I'm serious." The doctor composes a
professional face. "I know perfectly what you mean." He waits for
the next symptom.</p>

<p>"Now, mother never did wid, and never will wid, I hope. She hasn't
got it in her bones." And then Miss Sally stopped short, and a
little extra flush got time to assert itself. But a moment after she
rushed the position without a single casualty. "I want to know what
people say, when I'm not there, about who my father was, and why he
and mother parted. And I'm sure you can tell me, and will. It's no
use asking Tishy Wilson any more about it." Observe the transparency
of this young lady. She wasn't going to conceal that she had talked
of it to Tishy Wilson&mdash;not she!</p>

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Vereker, usually reserved, but candid withal, becomes, under the
infection of Sally's frankness, candid and unreserved.</p>

<p>"People haven't talked any nonsense to <i>me</i>; I never let them. But
my mother has repeated to me things that have been said to her....
She doesn't like gossip, you know!" And the young man really
believes what he says. Because his mother has been his
religion&mdash;just consider!</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 183 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"I know she doesn't." Sally analyses the position, and decides on
the fib in the twinkling of an eye. She is going to make a son break
a promise to his mother, and she knows it. So she gives him this as
a set-off. "But people <i>will</i> talk to her, of course! Shall I get
<i>her</i> to tell <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>The doctor considers, then answers:</p>

<p>"I think, Miss Sally&mdash;unless you particularly wish the contrary&mdash;I
would almost rather not. Mother believed the story all nonsense, and
was very much concerned that people should repeat such silly tattle.
She would be very unhappy if she thought it had come to your ears
through her repeating it in confidence to me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would really rather not tell it, doctor."
Disappointment is on Sally's face.</p>

<p>"No. As you have asked me, I prefer to tell it. Only you won't speak
to her at all, will you?"</p>

<p>"I really won't. You may trust me."</p>

<p>"Well, then, it's really very little when all's said and done.
Somebody told her&mdash;I won't say who it was&mdash;you don't mind?" Sally
didn't&mdash;"told her that your father behaved very badly to your
mother, and that he tried to get a divorce from her and failed, and
that after that they parted by mutual consent, and he went away to
New Zealand when you were quite a small baby."</p>

<p>"Was that quite all?"</p>

<p>"That was all mother told me. I'm afraid I rather cut her short by
saying I thought it was most likely all unfounded gossip. Was any of
it true? But I've no right to ask questions...."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dr.&nbsp;Vereker&mdash;no! That wouldn't be fair. Of course, when you are
asked to tell, you are allowed to ask. Every one always is. Besides,
I don't mind a bit telling you all I know. Only you'll be surprised
at my knowing so very little."</p>

<p>And then Sally, with a clearness that did her credit, repeated all
the information she had had&mdash;all that her mother had told her&mdash;what
she had extracted from Colonel Lund with difficulty&mdash;and lastly, but
as the merest untrustworthy hearsay, the story that had reached her
through her friend L&aelig;titia. In fact, she went the length of
discrediting it altogether, as "Only Goody Wilson,

<!-- Page 184 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
when all was
said and done." The fact that her mother had told her so little
never seemed to strike her as strange or to call for comment. It was
right that it should be so, because it was in her mother's
jurisdiction, and what she did or said was right. Cannot most of us
recall things unquestioned in our youth that we have marvelled at
our passive acceptance of since? Sally's mother's silence about her
father was ingrained in the nature of things, and she had never
speculated about him so much as she had done since Professor
Wilson's remark across the table had led to L&aelig;titia's tale about
Major Roper and the tiger-shooting.</p>

<p>Sally's version of her mother's history was comforting to her hearer
on one point: it contained no hint that the fugitive to Australia
was not her father. Now, the fact is that the doctor, in repeating
what his mother had said to him, had passed over some speculations
of hers about Sally's paternity. No wonder the two records confirmed
each other, seeing that the point suppressed by the doctor had been
studiously kept from Sally by all her informants. He, for his part,
felt that the bargain did not include speculations of his mother's.</p>

<p>"Well, doctor?" Thus Sally, at the end of a very short pause for
consideration. Vereker does not seem to need a longer one. "You
mean, Miss Sally, do I think people talk spitefully of Mrs.
Nightingale&mdash;I suppose I must say Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick now&mdash;behind her back?
Isn't that the sort of question?" Sally, for response, looks a
little short nod at the doctor, instead of words. He goes on: "Well,
then, I don't think they do. And I don't think you need fret about
it. People will talk about the story of the quarrel and separation,
of course, but it doesn't follow that anything will be said against
either your father or mother. Things of this sort happen every day,
with fault on neither side."</p>

<p>"You think it was just a row?"</p>

<p>"Most likely. The only thing that seems to me to tell against your
father is what you said your mother said just now&mdash;something about
having forgiven him for your sake." Sally repeats her nod. "Well,
even that might be accounted for by supposing that he had been very
hot-tempered and unjust and violent. He was quite a young chap, you
see...."</p>

<p>"You mean like&mdash;like supposing Jeremiah were to go into a tantrum

<!-- Page 185 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
now and flare up&mdash;he does sometimes&mdash;and then they were both to miff
off?"</p>

<p>"Something of that sort. Very likely they would have understood each
other better if they had been a little older and wiser...."</p>

<p>"Like us?" says Sally, with perfect unconsciousness of one aspect of
the remark. "And then they might have gone on till now." Regret that
they did not do so is on her face, till she suddenly sees a new
contingency. "But then we shouldn't have had Jeremiah. I shouldn't
have fancied that at all." She doesn't really see why the doctor
smiled at this, but adds a grave explanation: "I mean, if I'd tried
both, I might have preferred my step." But there they were at
Glenmoira Road, and must say good-bye till Brahms on Thursday.</p>

<p>Only, the doctor did (as a matter of history) walk down that road
with Sally as far as the gate with Krakatoa Villa on it, and got
home late for his mid-day Sunday dinner, and was told by his mother
that he might have considered the servants. She herself was, meekly,
out of it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF A SWIMMING-BATH, "ET PR&AElig;TEREA EXIGUUM"</p>

<p>This was the best of the swimming-bath season, and Sally rarely
passed a day without a turn at her favourite exercise. If her
swimming-bath had been open on Sunday, she wouldn't have gone to
church yesterday, not even to meet Dr.&nbsp;Vereker and talk about her
father to him. As it was, she very nearly came away from Krakatoa
Villa next morning without waiting to see the letter from Rheims,
the post being late. Why <i>is</i> everything late on Monday?</p>

<p>However, she was intercepted by the postman and the foreign
postmark&mdash;a dozen words on a card, but she read them several times,
and put the card in her pocket to show to L&aelig;titia Wilson. She was
pretty sure to be there. And so she was, and by ten o'clock had seen
the card and exhausted its contents. And by five-minutes-past Sally
was impending over the sparkling water of Paddington swimming-bath.
She was dry so far, and her blue bathing-dress could stick out. But
it was not to be for long, for her two hands went together after a
preliminary stretch to make a cutwater, and down went Sally with a
mighty splash into the deep&mdash;into the moderately deep, suppose we
say&mdash;at any rate into ten thousand gallons of properly filtered
Thames water, which had been (no doubt) sterilised and disinfected
and examined under powerful microscopes until it hadn't got a
microbe to bless itself with. When she came up at the other end, to
taunt L&aelig;titia Wilson with her cowardice for not doing likewise, she
was a smooth and shiny Sally, like a deep blue seal above water, but
with modifications towards floating fins below.</p>

<p>"Now tell me about the row last night," said she, after reproaches
met by L&aelig;titia with, "It's no use, dear. I wasn't born a herring
like you."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 187 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Sally must have heard there had been some family dissension at
Ladbroke Grove Road as she came into the bath with L&aelig;titia, whom she
met at the towel-yielding <i>guichet</i>. However, the latter wasn't
disposed to discuss family matters in an open swimming-bath in the
hearing of the custodian, to say nothing of possible concealed
dressers in horse-boxes alongside.</p>

<p>"My dear child, <i>is</i> this the place to talk about things in? <i>Do</i> be
a little discreet sometimes," is her reply to Sally's request.</p>

<p>"There's nobody here but us. Cut away, Tishy!" But Miss Wilson will
<i>not</i> talk about the row, whatever it was, with the chance of
goodness-knows-who coming in any minute. For one thing, she wants to
enjoy the telling, and not to be interrupted. So it is deferred to a
more fitting season and place.</p>

<p>Goodness-knows-who (presumably) came in in the shape of Henriette
Prince, who was, after Sally, the next best swimmer in the Ladies'
Club. After a short race or two, won by Sally in spite of heavy odds
against her, the two girls turned their attention to the art of
rescuing drowning persons. A very amusing game was played, each
alternately committing suicide off the edge of the bath while the
other took a header to her rescue from the elevation which we just
now saw Sally on ready to plunge. The rules were clear. The suicide
was to do her best to drag the rescuer under water and to avoid
being dragged into the shallow end of the bath.</p>

<p>"I know you'll both get drowned if you play those tricks," says
L&aelig;titia nervously.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;we <i>shan't</i>," vociferates Sally from the brink. "Now, are you
ready, Miss Prince? Very well. Tishy, count ten!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish you wouldn't! One&mdash;two&mdash;three...." And L&aelig;titia, all
whose dignity and force of character go when she is bathing, does as
she is bidden, and, at the "ten," the suicide, with a cry of
despair, hurls herself madly into the water, and the rescuer flies
to her succour. What she has to do is to grasp the struggling quarry
by the elbows from behind and keep out of the reach of her hands.
But the tussle that ensues in the water is a short one, for the
rescuer is no match for the supposed involuntary resistance of the
convulsed suicide, who eludes the coming grasp of her hand with
eel-like dexterity, and has her round

<!-- Page 188 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the waist and drags her under
water in a couple of seconds.</p>

<p>"There now!" says Sally triumphantly, as they stand spluttering and
choking in the shallow water to recover breath. "Didn't I do that
beautifully?"</p>

<p>"Well, but <i>anybody</i> could like that. When real people are drowning
they don't do it like that." Miss Prince is rather rueful about it.
But Sally is exultant.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't they!" she says. "They're worse when it's real
drowning&mdash;heaps worse!" Whereon both the other girls affirm in
chorus that then nobody can be saved without the Humane Society's
drags&mdash;unless, indeed, you wait till they are insensible.</p>

<p>"Can't they?" says Sally, with supreme contempt. "We were both of us
drowned that time fair. But now you go and drown yourself, and see
if I don't fish you out. Fire away!"</p>

<p>They fire away, and the determined suicide plays her part with
spirit. But she is no match for the submarine tactics of her
rescuer, who seems just as happy under water as on land, and rising
under her at the end of a resolute deep plunge, makes a successful
grasp at the head of her prey, who is ignominiously towed into
safety, doing her best to drown herself to the last.</p>

<p>This little incident is so amusing and exciting that the three young
ladies, who walk home together westward, can talk of nothing but
rescues all the way to Notting Hill. Then Miss Henriette Prince goes
on alone, and as L&aelig;titia and Sally turn off the main road towards
the home of the former, the latter says: "Now tell me about the
row."</p>

<p>It wasn't exactly a row, it seemed; but it came to the same thing.
Mamma had made up her mind to be detestable about Julius
Bradshaw&mdash;that was the long and short of it. And Sally knew, said
L&aelig;titia, how detestable mamma could be when she tried. If it wasn't
for papa, Julius Bradshaw would simply be said not-at-home to, and
have to leave a card and go. But she was going to go her own way and
not be dictated to, maternal authority or no. Perhaps the speaker
felt that Sally was mentally taking exception to universal revolt,
for a flavour of excuse or justification crept in.</p>

<p>"Well!&mdash;I can't help it. I <i>am</i> twenty-four, after all. I shouldn't
say so if there was anything against him. But no man

<!-- Page 189 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
can be blamed
for a cruel conjunction of circumstances, and mamma may say what she
likes, but being in the office really makes all the difference. And
look how he's supporting his mother and sister, who were left badly
off. <i>I</i> call it noble."</p>

<p>"But you know, Tishy, you did say the negro couldn't change his
spots, and that I must admit there were such things as social
distinctions&mdash;and you talked about sweeps and dustmen, you know you
did. Come, Tishy, did you, or didn't you?"</p>

<p>"If I said anything it was leopard, not negro. And as for sweeps and
dustmen, they were merely parallel cases used as illustrations; and
I don't think I deserve to have them raked up...." Miss Wilson is
rather injured over this grievance, and Sally appeases her. "She
shan't have them raked up, she shan't! But what was this row really
about, that's the point? It was yesterday morning, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"How often am I to tell you, Sally dear, that there was really no
<i>row</i>, property speaking. If you were to say there had been comments
at breakfast yesterday, then recrimination overnight, and a
stiffness at breakfast again this morning, you would be doing more
than justice to it. You'll see now if mamma isn't cold and firm and
disinherity and generally detestable about it."</p>

<p>"But what <i>was</i> it? That's what <i>I</i> want to know."</p>

<p>"My dear&mdash;it was&mdash;absolutely nothing! Why should it be stranger for
Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw to drive me home to save two hansoms than for you and
Dr.&nbsp;Vereker and the Voyseys to go all in one growler?"</p>

<p>"Because the Voyseys live just round the corner, quite close. It
came to three shillings because it's outside the radius." The
irrelevancy of this detail gives L&aelig;titia an excuse for waiving the
cab-question, on which her position is untenable. She dilutes it
with extraneous matter, and it is lost sight of.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter whether it's cabs or what it is. Mamma's just the
same about everything. Even walking up Holland Park Lane after the
concert at Kensington Town Hall. I am sure if ever anything was
reasonable, that was." She pauses for confirmation&mdash;is, in fact,
wavering about the correctness of her own position, and weakly
seeking reassurance. She is made happier by a nod of assent from
Miss Sally. "Awfully reasonable!" is the verdict of the latter.
Whatever there is lacking seriousness

<!-- Page 190 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
in the judge's face is too
slight to call for notice&mdash;a mere twinkle to be ignored. Very little
self-deception is necessary, and in this department success is
invariable.</p>

<p>"I knew you would say so, dear," Tishy continues. "And I'm sure you
would about the other things too ... well, I was thinking about tea
in Kensington Gardens on Sunday. We have both of us a perfect right
to have tea independently, and the only question is about separate
tables."</p>

<p>"Suppose I come&mdash;to make it square."</p>

<p>"Suppose you do, dear." And the proposal is a relief evidently.</p>

<p>A very slight insight into the little drama that is going on at
Ladbroke Grove Road is all that is wanted for the purposes of this
story. The foregoing dialogue, ending at the point at which the two
young women disappear into the door of No. 287, will be sufficient
to give a fairly clear idea of the plot of the performance, and to
point to its <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>. The exact details may unfold themselves
as the story proceeds. The usual thing is a stand-up fight over the
love-affair, both parties to which have made up their
minds&mdash;becoming more and more obdurate as they encounter opposition
from without&mdash;followed by reconciliations more or less real. Let us
hope for the former in the present case, and that Miss Wilson and
Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw's lot may not be crossed by one of those developments
of strange inexplicable fury which so often break out in families
over the schemes of two young people to do precisely what their
parents did before them; and most ungovernably, sometimes, on the
part of members who have absolutely no suggestion to make of any
alternative scheme for the happiness of either.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="subhead">HOW FENWICK KNEW ALL ABOUT THE MASS. AND HOW BARON KREUTZKAMMER
RECOGNISED MR.&nbsp;HARRISSON. LONDON AGAIN!</p>

<p>"Why do they call it the <i>messe des paresseux</i>?" The question must
have been asked just as Sally looked at her watch because she saw
the clock had stopped. But the nave of the Cathedral of Rheims was
very unlike that of St.&nbsp;Satisfax as the bride and bridegroom
lingered in out of the sunshine, and the former took the
unwarrantable liberty, for a heretic, of crossing herself from the
Holy Water at the foot of the column near the door. But she made up
for it by the amount of <i>sous</i> she gave to the old blind woman, who
must have been knitting there since the days of Napoleon at least,
if she began in her teens.</p>

<p>"You haven't done it right, dearest. I knew you wouldn't. Look
here." And Fenwick crosses himself <i>secundum artem</i>, dipping his
finger first to make it valid.</p>

<p>"But how came you to know?" His wife does not say this; she only
thinks it. And how came he to know about the <i>messe des paresseux</i>?
She repeats her question aloud.</p>

<p>"Because the lazy people don't come to Mass till ten," he replies.
They are talking under their breath, as English folk do in foreign
churches, heedless of the loud gabble and resonant results of too
much snuff on the part of ecclesiastics off duty. Their own
salvation has been cultivated under a list slipper, cocoanut
matting, secretive pew-opener policy; and if they are new to it all,
they are shocked to see the snuff taken over the heads and wooden
<i>sabots</i> of the devout country-folk, whose ancestors knelt on the
same hard stone centuries ago, and prayed for great harvests that
never came, and to avert lean years that very often did. The
Anglican cannot understand the real aboriginal Papist. Sally's
mother was puzzled when she saw an old, old kneeling figure,
toothless and parchment-skinned, on whose rosary a pinch of snuff
<i>ut supra</i> descended, shake it off

<!-- Page 192 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the bead in evidence, and get on
to the next <i>Ave</i>, even as one who has business before her&mdash;so many
pounds of oakum to pick, so many bushels of peas to shell. It was a
reality to her; and there was the Blessed Virgin herself, a visible
certainty, who would see to the recognition of it at headquarters.</p>

<p>Fenwick passed up the aisle, dreamily happy in the smell of the
incense, beside his bride of yesterday's making&mdash;she intensely happy
too, but in another way, for was not her bridegroom of yesterday her
husband of twenty years ago&mdash;cruelly wrenched away, but her husband
for all that. Still, there was always that little rift within the
lute that made the music&mdash;pray Heaven not to widen! Always that
thought!&mdash;that he might recollect. How could he remember the <i>messe
des paresseux</i>, and keep his mind a blank about how he came to know
of it? It was the first discomfort that had crossed her married
mind&mdash;put it away!</p>

<p>It was easy to put it all away and forget it in the hush and gloom
of the great church, filled with the strange intonation from
Heaven-knows-where&mdash;some side-chapel unseen&mdash;of a Psalm it would
have puzzled David to be told was his, and a scented vapour Solomon
would have known at once; for neither myrrh nor frankincense have
changed one whit since his day. It was easy enough so long as both
sat listening to <i>Gloria in excelsis Deo, et in terra pax</i>. Carried
<i>nem. con.</i> by all sorts and conditions of Creeds. But when the
little bobs and tokens and skirt-adjustments of the fat priest and
his handsome abettor (a young fellow some girl might have been the
wife of, with advantage to both) came to a pause, and the
congregation were to be taken into confidence, how came Gerry to
know beforehand what the fat one was going to say, with that
stupendous voice of his?</p>

<p>"<i>Hoc est corpus meum, et hic est calix sanguinis mei.</i> We all
kneel, I think." Thus the bridegroom under his breath. And his
companion heard, almost with a shudder, the selfsame words from the
priest, as the kneeling of the congregation subsided.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gerry&mdash;darling fellow! How <i>can</i> you know that, and not
know...."</p>

<p>"How I came by it? It's very funny, but I <i>can't</i>, and that's the

<!-- Page 193 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
truth. I don't feel as if I ever <i>could</i> know, what's more. But it
all seems a matter of course."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're a Catholic all the while, without knowing it?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am. But I should like to know, because of going to the
other place with you. I shouldn't care about purgatory without you,
Rosey dearest. No&mdash;not even with a reversionary interest in heaven."</p>

<p>And then the plot thickened at the altar, and the odour of myrrh and
frankincense, and little bells rang to a climax, and the handsome
young priest, let us hope, felt he had got value for the loss of
that hypothetical girl.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>That little incident in the great church at Rheims was the first
anxiety of Rosalind Fenwick's married life&mdash;the first resumption of
the conditions she had been so often unnerved by during the period
of their betrothal. She was destined to be crossed by many such. But
she was, as we have said, a strong woman, and had made up her mind
to take these anxieties as part of the day's work&mdash;a charge upon her
happiness that had to be paid. It was a great consolation to her
that she could speak to her husband about the tension caused by her
misgivings without assigning any special reasons for anxiety that
would not be his as much as hers. She had to show uneasiness in
order to get the relief his sympathy gave her; but there were
unknown possibilities in the Bush enough to warrant it without going
outside what was known to both. No need at all that he should know
of her separate unseen burden, for that!</p>

<p>But some of the jolts on the road, as we might call them, were to be
sore trials to Rosalind. One came in the fourth week of their
honeymoon, and quite spoiled for her the last three days of her
holiday. However, Fenwick himself laughed about it&mdash;that was one
comfort.</p>

<p>It was at Sonnenberg. You know the Great Hotel, or Pension, near the
Seelisberg, that looks down on Lucerne Lake, straight over to where
Tell shot the arrow? If you do not, it does not matter. Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.
Fenwick had never been there before, and have never been there
since. And what happened might

<!-- Page 194 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
just as easily have happened
anywhere else. But it was there, as a matter of fact; and if you
know the place, you will be able to imagine the two of them leaning
on the parapet of the terrace that overlooks the lake, watching the
steamer from Lucerne creeping slowly to the landing-place at the
head of a white comet it has churned the indescribable blue of the
lake to, and discussing whether it is nearest to Oriental sapphire
or to green jasper at its bluest.</p>

<p>Rosalind had got used to continual wonderment as to when and where
Fenwick had come to know so well this thing and that thing he spoke
of so familiarly; so she passed by the strange positiveness of his
speech about the shades of jasper, the scarcity of really blue
examples, and his verdict that the bluest possible one would be just
the colour of that water below them. She was not going to ask him
how he came to be so mighty wise about chalcedony and chrysoprase
and sardonyx, about which she herself either never knew or had
forgotten. She took it all as a matter of course, and asked if the
Baron's cigar was a good one.</p>

<p>"Magnificent!" Fenwick replied, puffing at it. "How shall we return
his civility?"</p>

<p>"Give <i>him</i> a cigar next time you get a chance."</p>

<p>Fenwick laughs, in derision of his own cigars.</p>

<p>"God bless me, my dearest love! Why, one of the Baron's is worth my
whole box. We must discover something better than that." Both ponder
over possible reciprocities in silence, but discover nothing, and
seem to give up the quest by mutual consent. Then he says: "I wonder
why he cosseted up to us last night in the garden so!" And she
repeats: "I wonder why!"</p>

<p>"I don't believe he even knows our name," she continues; and then he
repeats: "<i>I</i> don't believe he knows our name. I'm sure he doesn't."</p>

<p>"And it was so dark, he couldn't have seen much of us. But his
cigar's quite beautiful. Blow the smoke in my face, Gerry!" She
shuts her eyes to receive it. How handsome Sally would think mamma
was looking if she could see her now in the light of the sunset! Her
husband thinks much to that effect, as he turns to blow the smoke on
order into the face that is so close to his, as they lean arm-in-arm
on the parapet the sun has left his warmth

<!-- Page 195 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
on, and means to take
his eyes off in half an hour. They really look quite a young couple,
and the frivolity of their conduct adds to the effect. Nobody would
believe in her grown-up daughter, to see that young Mrs.&nbsp;Algernon
Fenwick.</p>

<p>"I am ferry root, Mrs.&nbsp;Harrisson. If I introot, you shall say I
introot." It is the Baron, manifestly. His form&mdash;or rather his bulk,
for he cannot be said to have a form; he is amorphous&mdash;is baronial
in the highest degree. His stupendous chest seems to be a huge
cavern for the secretion of gutturals, which are discharged as heavy
artillery at a hint from some unseen percussion-cap within.</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick starts, a little taken aback at the Baron's
thunderclap; for he had approached unawares, and her closed eyes
helped on the effect. When they opened, they looked round, as for a
third person. But the Baron was alone.</p>

<p>"Where is Mrs.&nbsp;Harrisson?" She asks the question with the most
absolute unconsciousness that she was herself the person addressed.
The Baron, still believing, presumably, that Fenwick is <i>Mr.</i>
Harrisson, is not a person to be trusted with the position created.
He develops an offensive waggery, shakes the forefinger that has
detected an escapade, and makes of his lips the round <i>O</i> of shocked
propriety, at heart in sympathy with the transgressor. His little
grey eyes glare through his gold-rimmed spectacles, and his huge
chest shakes with a substratum of laughter, only just loud enough to
put in the text.</p>

<p>"O-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! No, do not be afraight. She is not here. We
unterzdant. It is all unterzdoot. We shall be ferry tizgreet...."
And then the Baron pats space with his fingers only, not moving his
hand, as a general indication of secrecy to the universe.</p>

<p>Probably the slight flush that mantles the face he speaks to is less
due to any offence at his fat, good-humoured German raillery than to
some vague apprehension of the real nature of the position about to
develop. But Fenwick imputes it to the former. If Rosey was inclined
to treat the thing as a harmless joke, he would follow suit; but she
looks hurt, and her husband, sensitive about every word that is said
to her, blazes out:</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean? What the devil do you mean? How dare you
speak to my wife like that?" He makes a half-step

<!-- Page 196 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
towards the burly
mass of flesh, still shaking with laughter. But his wife stops him.</p>

<p>"Do be patient, Gerry darling! Don't flare up like that. I'll have a
divorce. I'll tell Sally...." a threat which seems to have a
softening effect. "Can't you see, dear, that there is some
misunderstanding?" Fenwick looks from her to the Baron, puzzled. The
latter drops his jocular rallying.</p>

<p>"I saw last night you did not know me, Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson. That is
straintch! Have you forgotten Diedrich Kreutzkammer?" He says his
name with a sort of quiet confidence of immediate recognition. But
Fenwick only looks blankly at him.</p>

<p>"He does not know me!" cries the German, with an astonished voice.
"'Frisco&mdash;the Klondyke&mdash;Chicago&mdash;the bridge at Brooklyn&mdash;why, it is
not two years ago...." He pauses between the names of the places,
enforcing each as a reminder with an active forefinger.</p>

<p>Fenwick seems suddenly to breathe the fresh air of a solution of the
problem. He breaks into a sunny smile, to his wife's great relief.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Baron Kreutzkammer, <i>my</i> name is not Harrisson. <i>My</i> name
is Fenwick, and this lady is my wife&mdash;Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick. I have never
been in any of the places you mention." For the moment he forgot his
own state of oblivion: a thing he was getting more and more in the
habit of doing. The Baron looked intently at him, and looked again.
He slapped his forehead, not lightly at all, but as if good hard
slaps would really correct his misapprehensions and put him right
with the world.</p>

<p>"I am all <i>wronck</i>" he said, borrowing extra force from an indurated
<i>g</i>. "But it is ferry bustling&mdash;I am bustled!" By this he meant
puzzled. Fenwick felt apologetic.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to thank you for the cigar Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson ought to
have had," said he. He felt really ashamed of having smoked it under
false pretences.</p>

<p>"You shall throw it away, and I giff you one for yourself. That is
eacey! But I am bustled."</p>

<p>He continued puzzled. Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick felt that he was only keeping
further comment and inquiry in check because it would have been a
doubt thrown on her husband's word to make any. Her uneasiness would
have been visible if her power of concealing

<!-- Page 197 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
it had not been
fortified by her belief that his happiness as well as hers depended
(for the present, at any rate) on his ignorance of his own past.
Perhaps she was wrong; with that we have nothing to do; we are
telling of things as they happened. Only we wish to record our
conviction that Rosalind Fenwick was acting for her husband's sake
as well as her own&mdash;not from a vulgar instinct of self-preservation.</p>

<p>The Baron made conversation, and polished his little powerful
spectacle-lenses. He blew his nose like a salute of one gun in the
course of his polishing. When <i>we</i> blow <i>our</i> nose, we hush our
pocket-handkerchief back into its home, and ignore it a little. The
Baron didn't. He continued polishing on an unalloyed corner through
the whole of a very perceptible amount of chat about the tricks
memory plays us, and the probable depth of the blue water below.
Rosalind's uneasiness continued. It grew worse, when the Baron,
suddenly replacing his spectacles and fixing his eyes firmly on her
husband, said sternly, "Yes, it is a bustle!" but was relieved when
equally suddenly, he shouted in a stentorian voice, "We shall meed
lader," and took his leave.</p>

<p>"He's a jolly fellow, the Baron, anyhow!" said Fenwick. "I wonder
whether they heard him at Altdorf?"</p>

<p>"Every word, I should think. But how I should like to see the Mr.
Harrisson he took you for!"</p>

<p>This was really part of a policy of nettle-grasping, which
continued. She always felt happier after defying a difficulty than
after flinching. After all, if Gerry's happiness and her own were
not motive enough, consider Sally's. If she should really come to
know her mother's story, Sally might die of it.</p>

<p>Fenwick went on to the ending of the cigar, dreamily wondering,
evidently "bustled" like the Baron. As he blew the last smoke away,
and threw the smoking end down the slope, he repeated her words
spoken a minute before, "<i>I</i> should like to see the Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson he
took me for."</p>

<p>"It would be funny to see oneself as ithers see one. Some power
might gie you the giftie, Gerry. If only we could meet that Mr.
Harrisson!"</p>

<p>"Do you remember how we saw our profiles in a glass, and you said,
'I'm sure those are somebody else'? Illogical female!"</p>

<p>"Why was I illogical? I knew they were going to turn out us in

<!-- Page 198 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
the
end. But I was sure I shouldn't be convinced at once." And the talk
wandered away into a sort of paradoxical metaphysics.</p>

<p>But when, later in the evening, this lady was described by
confidential chat at the far end of the salon as that handsome young
Mrs.&nbsp;Algernon Fenwick who was only just married, and whose husband
was playing chess in the smoking-room, and what a pity it was they
were not going to stop over Monday, she thus described, accurately
enough, was rather rejoicing that that handsome Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick, who
looked like a Holbein portrait, was being kept quiet for half an
hour, because she wanted to get a chance for a little chat with that
dreadful noisy Prussian Von, who made all the glasses ring at table
when he shouted so. Rosalind had her own share of feminine
curiosity, don't you see? and she was not by any means satisfied
about Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson. She did not acknowledge the nature of her
suspicions to herself, but she would very much like to know, for all
that! She got her opportunity.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't the least mind myself if smoking <i>were</i> allowed in the
salon, Baron. You saw to-day that I really liked the smoke?"</p>

<p>"Ja! when I make that chogue. It was a root chogue. But I am
forgiffen?"</p>

<p>"It was Gerry who had to be forgiven, breaking out like that. I hope
he has promised not to do so any more?"</p>

<p>"He has bromiss to be goot. I have bromiss to be goot. We shall be
<i>sages enfants</i>, as the French say. But I will tell you, Madame
Fenwick, about my vrent Harrisson your Cherry is so ligue...."</p>

<p>"Let's go out on the terrace, then you can light a cigar and be
comfortable.... Yes, I'll have my wrap ... no, that's wrong-side-out
... that's right now.... Well, perhaps it will be a little cool for
sitting down. We can walk about."</p>

<p>"Now I can tell you about my vrent in America that your hussband is
so ligue. He could speague French&mdash;ferry well indeed." Rosalind
looked up. "It was when I heard your hussband speaguing French to
that grosse Grafin Pobzodonoff that I think to myself that was
Alchernon Harrisson that I knew in California."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 199 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Suppose we sit down. I don't think it's too cold.... Yes, this
place will do nicely. It's sheltered from the wind." If she does
look a little pale&mdash;and she feels she does&mdash;it will be quite
invisible in this dark corner, for the night is dark under a canopy
of blazing stars. "What were you saying about French?"</p>

<p>"Alchernon Harrisson&mdash;that was his name&mdash;he could speague it well.
He spogue id ligue a nadiff. Better than I speague English. I
speague English so well because I have a knees at Ganderbury." This
meant a niece at Canterbury. Baron Kreutzkammer speaks English so
well that it is almost a shame to lay stress on his pronunciation of
consonants. The spelling is difficult too, so we will give the
substance of what he told Rosalind without his articulation. By this
time she, for her part, was feeling thoroughly uneasy. It seemed to
her&mdash;but it may be she exaggerated&mdash;that nothing stood between her
husband and the establishment of his identity with this Harrisson
except the difference of name. And how could she know that he had
not changed his name? Had she not changed hers?</p>

<p>The Baron's account of Harrisson was that he made his acquaintance
about three years since at San Francisco, where he had come to
choose gold-mining plant to work a property he had purchased at
Klondyke. Rosalind found it a little difficult to understand the
account of how the acquaintance began, from want of knowledge of
mining machinery. But the gist of it was that the Baron, at that
time a partner in a firm that constructed stamping-mills, was
explaining the mechanism of one to Harrisson, who was standing close
to a small vertical pugmill, or mixer of some sort, just at the
moment the driving-engine had stopped and the fly-wheel had nearly
slowed down. He went carelessly too near the still revolving
machinery, and his coat-flap was caught and wound into the helix of
the pugmill. "It would have crowned me badly," said the Baron. But
he remained unground, for Harrisson, who was standing close to the
moribund fly-wheel, suddenly flung himself on it, and with
incredible strength actually cut short the rotation before the Baron
could be entangled in a remorseless residuum of crushing power,
which, for all it looked so gentle, would have made short work of a
horse's thigh-bone. The Baron's coat was spoiled, though

<!-- Page 200 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
he was
intact. But Harrisson's right arm had done more than a human arm's
fair share of work, and had to rest and be nursed. They had become
intimate friends, and the Baron had gone constantly to inquire after
the swelled arm. It took time to become quite strong again, he said.
It was a fine strong arm, and burned all over with gunpowder, "what
you call daddooed in English."</p>

<p>"Did it get quite well?"</p>

<p>"Ferry nearly. There was a little blaze in the choint here"&mdash;the
Baron touched his thumb&mdash;"where the bane remained&mdash;a roomadic bane.
He burgessed a gopper ring for it. It did him no goot." Luckily
Rosalind had discarded the magic ring long since, or it might have
come into court awkwardly.</p>

<p>If she still entertained any doubts about the identity of her
husband and Harrisson, the Baron's next words removed them. They
came in answer to an expression of wonder of hers that he should so
readily accept her husband's word for his identity in the face of
the evidence of his own senses. "I really think," she had said,
"that if I were in your place I should think he was telling fibs."
This was nettle-grasping.</p>

<p>"Ach, ach! No&mdash;no&mdash;no!" shouted the Baron, so loud that she was
afraid it would reach the chess-players in the smoking-room, "I
arrife at it by logic, by reasson. Giff me your attention." He held
up one finger firmly, as an act of hypnotism, to procure it. "Either
I am ride or I am wronck. I cannot be neither."</p>

<p>"You might be mistaken."</p>

<p>The Baron's finger waved this remark aside impatiently. "I will
fairy the syllogism," he shouted. "Either your husband <i>is</i> Mr.
Harrisson, or he is <i>not</i>. He cannot be neither." This was granted.
"Ferry well, then. If he is Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson, Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson has doled
fips. But I know Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson would not dell fips. Imbossible!"</p>

<p>"And if he is not?" The Baron points out that in this case his
statement is true by hypothesis, to say nothing of the intrinsic
probability of truthfulness on the part of any one so like Mr.
Harrisson. He is careful to dwell on the fact that this
consideration of the matter is purely analysis of a metaphysical
crux, indulged in for scientific illumination. He then goes on to

<!-- Page 201 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
apologize for having been so very positive. But no doubt one or two
minor circumstances had so affected his imagination that he saw a
very strong likeness where only a very slight one existed. "I shall
look again. I shall be wicer next time." But what were the minor
circumstances, Rosalind asked.</p>

<p>"There was the French&mdash;the lankwitch&mdash;that was one. But there was
another&mdash;his <i>noce</i>! I will tell you. When my frent Harrisson gribe
holt of that wheel, his head go down etchwice." The Baron tried to
hint at this with his own head, but his neck, which was like a
prize-bull's, would not lend itself to the illustration. "That wheel
was ferry smooth&mdash;with a sharp gorner. <i>His noce touch that
corner.</i>" The Baron said no more in words, but pantomimic action and
a whistle showed plainly how the wheel-rim had glided on the bridge
of Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson's nose. "It took off the gewdiggle, and made a
sgar. Your hussband's noce has that ferry sgar. That affected my
imatchination. It is easy to unterzdant."</p>

<p>But the subject was frightening Rosalind. She would have liked to
hear much more about Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson; might ever have ended by taking
the fat Baron, whom she thoroughly liked, into her confidence. The
difficulty, however, was about decision in immediate action, which
would be irrevocable. Silence was safer&mdash;or, sleep on it at least.
For now, she must change the conversation.</p>

<p>"How sweet the singing sounds under the starlight!" But the Baron
will not tolerate any such loose inaccuracy.</p>

<p>"It would sount the same in the taydime. The fibrations are the
same." But he more than makes up for his harsh prosaism by singing,
in unison with the singers unseen:</p>

<p class="song">
"Ich weiss nicht was soll es bedeuten<br />
Dass ich so traurig bin...."
</p>

<p>No one could ever have imagined that such heavenly sounds could come
from anything so fat and noisy. Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick shuts her eyes to
listen.</p>

<p>When she opens them again, jerked back from a temporary
dream-paradise by the Baron remarking with the voice of Stentor or
Boanerges that it is a "ferry broody lied," her husband is standing
there. He has been listening to the music. The Baron adds

<!-- Page 202 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
that his
friend Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson was "ferry vond of that lied."</p>

<p>But when the two of them have said a cordial good-night to the
unwieldy nightingale, who goes away to bed, as he has to leave early
in the morning, Fenwick is very silent, and once and again brushes
his hair about, and shakes his head in his old way. His wife sees
what it is. The music has gone as near touching the torpid memory as
the wild autumn night and the cloud-race round the moon had done in
the little front garden at home a year ago.</p>

<p>"A recurrence, Gerry?" she asks.</p>

<p>"Something of the sort, Rosey love," he says. "Something quite mad
this time. There was a steam-engine in it, of all things in the
world!" But it has been painful, evidently&mdash;a discomfort at
least&mdash;as these things always are.</p>

<p>Rosalind's apprehension of untimely revelations dictated a feeling
of satisfaction that the Baron was going away next day; her regret
at losing the choice of further investigation admitted one of
dissatisfaction that he had gone. The net result was unsettlement
and discomfort, which lasted through the remainder of Sonnenberg,
and did not lift altogether until the normallest of normal life came
back in a typical London four-wheeler, which dutifully obeyed the
injunction to "go slowly," not only through the arch that injunction
brooded over, but even to the end of the furlong outside the radius
which commanded an extra sixpence and got more. But what did that
matter when Sally was found watching at the gate for its advent, and
received her stepfather with an undisguised hug as soon as she found
it in her heart to relinquish her mother?</p>

<p class="subhead">MERE DAILY LIFE AT KRAKATOA. BUT SALLY IS QUITE FENWICK'S DAUGHTER
BY NOW. OF HER VIEWS ABOUT DR. VEREKER, AND OF TISHY'S AUNT FRANCES</p>

<p>When you come back from a holiday to a sodden and monstrous London,
it is best to be welcomed by something young&mdash;by a creature that is
convinced that it has been enjoying itself, and that convinces you
as well, although you can't for the life of you understand the
details. Why should anything enjoy itself or anything else in this
Cimmerian gloom, while away over there the great Alpine peaks are
white against the blue, and otherwhere the music of a hundred seas
mixes with their thunder on a thousand shores? Why come home?</p>

<p>But when we do and find that nothing particular has happened, and
that there's a card for us on the mantelpiece, how stuffy are our
welcomers, and how well they tone into the surrounding grey when
they are elderly and respectable? It is different when we find that,
from their point of view, it is we that have been the losers by our
absence from all the great and glorious fun the days have been made
of while we were away on a mistaken and deluded continent, far from
this delectable human ant-hill&mdash;this centre and climax of Life with
a capital letter. But then, when this is so, they have to be young,
as Sally was.</p>

<p>The ex-honeymooners came back to jubilant records of that young
lady's experience during the five weeks of separation. She listened
with impatience to counter records of adventures abroad, much
preferring to tell of her own at home. Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick
acquiesced in the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of listeners, and left the rostrum to Sally
after they had been revived with soup, and declined cutlets, because
they really had had plenty to eat on the way. The rostrum happened
to be a hassock on the hearthrug, before

<!-- Page 204 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the little bit of fire
that wasn't at all unwelcome, because September had set in quite
cold already, and there was certain to be a warm Christmas if it
went on like this, and it would be very unhealthy.</p>

<p>"And oh, do you know"&mdash;thus Sally, after many other matters had been
disposed of&mdash;"there has been such an awful row between Tishy and her
mother about Julius Bradshaw?" Sally is serious and impressed;
doesn't see the comic side, if there is one. Her mother felt that if
there was to be a volley of indignation discharged at Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson
for her share in the row, she herself, as belonging to the class
mother, might feel called on to support her, and was reserved
accordingly.</p>

<p>"I suppose L&aelig;titia wants to marry Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"Of course that's it! He hasn't proposed, because he's promised not
to; but he will any time Tishy gives a hint. Meanwhile Goody Wilson
has refused to sanction his visits at the house, and L&aelig;titia has
said she will go into lodgings."</p>

<p>"Sally darling, I do wish you wouldn't call all the married ladies
of your acquaintance <i>Goody</i>. You'll do it some day to their faces."</p>

<p>"It's only the middle-aged bouncers."</p>

<p>"Well, dear chick, do try and not call them Goody. What did
Goo&mdash;there! I was going to do it myself. What did Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson say to
that?"</p>

<p>"Said Tishy's allowance wouldn't cover lodgings, and she had nothing
else to fall back on. So we go into the Park instead."</p>

<p>Even Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick's habituation to her daughter's incisive method is
no proof against this. She breaks into an affectionate laugh, and
kisses its provoker, who protests.</p>

<p>"We-e-ell! There's nothing in <i>that</i>. We have tea in the shilling
places under the trees in Kensington Gardens. <i>That's</i> all right."</p>

<p>"Of course that's all right&mdash;with a <i>chaperon</i> like you! Who <i>could</i>
say anything? But do tell me, Sally darling, does Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson
dislike this young man on his own account, or is it only the shop?"</p>

<p>"Only the shop, I do believe. And Tishy's twenty-four! What

<!-- Page 205 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
<i>is</i> my
stepfather sitting smiling at there in that contented way? Is that a
Mossoo cigar? It smells very nice."</p>

<p>"I was smiling at you, Sarah. No, it's not a Mossoo that I know of.
A German Baron gave it me.... No, dearest! It really <i>was</i> all
right.... No&mdash;I really can't exactly say how; but it <i>was</i> all right
for all that...." This was in answer to a comment of his wife.</p>

<p>"Never mind the German Baron," Sally interrupts. "What business have
you to smile at me, Jeremiah?" They had christened each other
Jeremiah and Sarah for working purposes.</p>

<p>"Because I chose&mdash;because you're such a funny little article." He
comes a little nearer to her, and putting his arm round her neck,
pinches her off-cheek. She gives him a very short kiss&mdash;hardly a
real one&mdash;just an acknowledgment. He remains with her little white
hand in his great hairy one, and she leans against him and accepts
the position. But that cigar is on her mother's mind.</p>

<p>"How many did he give you, Gerry? Now tell the truth."</p>

<p>"He gave me a lot. I smuggled them. I can't tell you <i>why</i> it seemed
all right I should accept them. But it <i>did</i>."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know best, dear. Men are men, and I'm a female. But
he was such a perfect stranger." She, of course, knew quite well
that he was not, but there was nettle-grasping in it on her part.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was. But somehow he didn't seem so. Perhaps it was because
I flew into such a rage with him about what he called his 'crade
chogue.' But it wasn't <i>only</i> that. Something about the chap
himself&mdash;I can't tell what." And Fenwick becomes <i>distrait</i>, with a
sort of restless searching on his face. He sits on, silent, patting
Sally's little white hand in his, and letting the prized cigar take
care of itself, and remains silent until, after a few more
interesting details about the "great row" at Ladbroke Grove Road,
all three agree that sleep is overdue, and depart to receive
payment.</p>

<p>Rosalind knows the meaning of it all perfectly. Some tiny trace of
memory of the fat Kreutzkammer lingered in her husband's crippled
mind&mdash;something as confused as the revolving engine's connexion with
the German volkslied. But enough to prevent his feeling the ten
francs' worth of cigars an oppressive

<!-- Page 206 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
benevolence. It was very
strange to her that it should so happen, but, having happened, it
did not seem unnatural. What was stranger still was that Gerry
should be there, loving Sally like a father&mdash;just as her own
stepfather Paul Nightingale had come to love <i>her</i>&mdash;caressing her,
and never dreaming for a moment how that funny little article came
about. Yes, come what might, she would do her best to protect these
two from that knowledge, however many lies she had to tell. She was
far too good and honourable a woman to care a particle about
truthfulness as a means to an easy conscience; she did not mind the
least how much hers suffered if it was necessary to the happiness of
others that it should do so. And in her judgment&mdash;though we admit
she may have been wrong&mdash;a revelation of the past would have taken
all the warmth and light out of the happy and contented little world
of Krakatoa Villa. So long as she had the cloud to herself, and saw
the others out in the sunshine, she felt safe, and that all was
well.</p>

<p>She would have liked companionship inside the cloud, for all that.
It was a cruel disappointment to find, when she came to reflect on
it, that she could not carry out a first intention of taking Colonel
Lund into her confidence about the Baron, and the undoubted insight
he had given into some portion of Fenwick's previous life. Obviously
it would have involved telling her husband's whole story. Her belief
that he was Harrisson involved her knowledge that he was not
Fenwick. The Major would have said at once: "Why not tell him all
this Baron told you, and see if it wouldn't bring all his life back
to him?" And then she would have to tell the Major who he really
was, to show him the need of keeping silence about the story. No,
no! Danger lay that way. Too much finessing would be wanted; too
many reserves.</p>

<p>So she bore her secret knowledge alone, for their sakes feeling all
the while like the scapegoat in the wilderness. But it was a happy
wilderness for her, as time proved. Her husband's temper and
disposition were well described by Sally, when she told Dr.&nbsp;Vereker
in confidence one day that when he boiled he blew the lid off, but
that he was a practical lamb, and was wax in her mother's hands. A
good fizz did good, whatever people said. And the doctor agreed
cordially. For he had a mother whose temper

<!-- Page 207 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
was notoriously
sweetness itself, but was manipulated by its owner with a dexterity
that secured all the effects of discomfort to its beneficiaries,
without compromising her own claims to canonization.</p>

<p>Fenwick's temper&mdash;this expression always means want of temper, or
absence of temper&mdash;was of the opposite sort. It occasioned no
inconvenience to any one, and every one detected and classed it
after knowing him for twenty-four hours. The married couple had not
existed for three months in that form before this trivial
individuality was defined by Ann and Cook as "only master." Sally
became so callous after a slight passing alarm at one or two
explosions that she would, for instance, address her stepfather,
after hearing his volleys at some offender in the distance, with,
"Who did I hear you calling a confounded idiot, Jeremiah?" To which
he would reply, softening into a genial smile: "Lost my temper, I
did, Sarah dear. Lost my temper with the Wash. The Wash sticks in
pins and the heads are too small to get hold of"; or, "People
shouldn't lick their envelopes up to the hilt, and spoil one's
ripping-corner, unless they want a fellow to swear"; or something
similar belonging to the familiar trials of daily life.</p>

<p>But really safety-valve tempers are so common that Fenwick's would
scarcely have called for notice if it had not been that, on one
occasion, a remark of Sally's about a rather more vigorous <i>&eacute;meute</i>
than usual led her mother, accidentally thrown off her guard, to
reply: "Yes! But you have no idea how much better he is&mdash;&mdash;" and
then to stop suddenly, seeing the mistake she was making. She had no
time to see a way out of the difficulty before Sally, puzzled,
looked at her with: "Better than when? I've known him longer than
you have, mother." For Sally always boasted of her earlier
acquaintance.</p>

<p>"No <i>when</i> at all, kitten! How much better he is when we are alone!
He never flares up then&mdash;that's what I meant." But she knew quite
well that her sentence, if finished, would have stood, "how much
better he is than he used to be!" She was too candid a witness in
the court of her own conscience to make any pretence that this
wasn't a lie. Of course it was; but if she never had to tell a worse
one than that for Sally's sake, she would be fortunate indeed.</p>

</div>

<p>She was much more happy in the court of her conscience than she was
in that of St.&nbsp;Satisfax&mdash;if we may ascribe a judicial status to him,
to help us through with our analysis of her frame of mind. His was a
court which, if not identical at all points with the analogous
exponents of things Divine in her youth, was fraught with the same
jurisdiction; was vocal with resonances that proclaimed the same
consequences to the unredeemed that the mumblings of a pastor of her
early days, remembered with little gratitude, had been inarticulate
with. Her babyhood had received the idea that liars would be sent
unequivocally to hell, and her maturity could not get rid of it.
Outside the precinct of the saint, the brief working morality that
considers other folk first was enough for her; within it, the
theologism of an offended deity still held a traditional sway.
Outside, her whole soul recoiled from the idea of her child knowing
a story that would eat into her heart like a cancer; within, a
reserve-corner of that soul, inoculated when it was new and
susceptible, shuddered at her unselfish adhesion to the only means
by which that child could be kept in ignorance.</p>

<p>However, she was clear about one thing. She would apologize in
prayer; but she would go to hell rather than have Sally made
miserable. Thus it came about that Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick continued a very
devout church-goer, and, as her husband never left her side when he
had a choice, he, too, became a frequent guest of St.&nbsp;Satisfax, whom
he seemed to regard as a harmless though fantastic person who lived
in some century or other, only you always forgot which.</p>

<p>His familiarity with the usages of the reformed St.&nbsp;Satisfax, and
his power of discriminating the lapses of that saint towards the
vices of his early unregenerate days&mdash;he being all the while
perfectly unconscious how he came to know anything of
either&mdash;continued to perplex his wife, and was a source of lasting
bewilderment to Sally. A particular incident growing out of this was
always associated in Rosalind's mind with an epithet he then applied
to Sally for the first time, but which afterwards grew to be
habitual with him.</p>

<p>"Of course, it's the Communion-table," he said in connexion with
some discussion of church furniture. "We have no altars in our
church nowadays. You're a Papist, Sarah!"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 209 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"I thought Communion-tables were an Evangelical start," said Sally
irreverently. "A Low Church turn-out. Our Mr.&nbsp;Prince is a
Tractarian, and a Ritualist, and a Puseyite, and an Anglican. That's
his game! The Bishop of London won't let him perform High Mass, and
<i>I</i> think it a shame! Don't you?... But I say, Jeremiah!" And
Jeremiah refrained from expressing whatever indignation he felt with
the Bishop of London, to find what Sally said. It was to the effect
that it was incredible that he should know absolutely nothing about
the original source of his information.</p>

<p>"I can only tell you, Sarah dear," he said, with the ring of sadness
in his voice that always came on this topic, "that I <i>do</i> remember
nothing of the people who taught me, or the place I learned in. Yet
I know about Tract No. 90, and Pusey and Newman, for all that. How I
remember things that were information, and forget things that were
things, is more than I can tell you. But can't you think of bits of
history you know quite well, without ever recalling where you got
them from?"</p>

<p>"Of course I can. At least, I could if I knew some history. Only I
don't. Oh yes, I do. Perkin Warbeck and Anne of Cleves. I've
forgotten about them now, only I know I knew them both. I've
answered about them in examinations. They're history all right
enough. As to who taught me about them, couldn't say!"</p>

<p>"Very well, Sarah. Now put a good deal of side into your stroke, and
you'll arrive at me."</p>

<p>But the revival of the old question had dug up discomfort his mind
had done its best to inter; and he went silent and sat with a
half-made cigarette in his fingers thinking gravely. Rosalind, at a
writing-table behind him, moved her lips at Sally to convey an
injunction. Sally, quickly apprehensive, understood it as "Let him
alone! Don't rake up the electrocution!" But Sally's native
directness betrayed her, and before she had time to think, she had
said, "All right; I won't." The consequence of which was that
Fenwick&mdash;being, as Sally afterwards phrased it, "too sharp by
half"&mdash;looked up suddenly from his reverie, and said, as he finished
rolling his cigarette, "What won't our daughter?"</p>

<p>The pleasure that struck through his wife's heart was audible in

<!-- Page 210 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
her voice as she caught it up. "Our daughter won't be a silly
inquisitive little puss-cat, darling. It only worries you, and does
no good." And he replied to her, as she came behind him and stood
with an appreciative side-face against his, with a semi-apology for
the phrase "daughter," and allowed the rest of what they were
speaking of to lapse.</p>

<p>"I called her it for the pleasure of saying it," said he. "It
sounded so nice!" And then he knew that her kiss was approval, but
of course had no conception of its thoroughness. For her part, she
hardly dared to think of the strangeness of the position; she could
only rejoice at its outcome.</p>

<p>After that it became so natural to him to speak of Sally as "our
daughter" that often enough new acquaintances misconceived her
relation to him, and had a shrewd insight that Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick
must have been married very young. Once some visitors&mdash;a lady with
one married daughter and two single ones&mdash;were so powerfully
impressed with Sally's resemblance to her supposed parent that
three-fourths of them went unconvinced away, in spite of the efforts
of the whole household to remove the error. The odd fourth was
supposed to have carried away corrective information. "I got the
flat one, with the elbows, in a quiet corner," said Sally, "and told
her Jeremiah was only step. Because they all shouted at once, so it
was impossible to make them hear in a lump."</p>

<p>Mistakes of this sort, occurring frequently, reacted on Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.
Fenwick, who found in them a constant support and justification for
the theory that Sally was really the daughter of both, while
admitting intellectual rejection of it to be plausible to
commonplace minds. They themselves got on a higher level, where
<i>ex-post-facto</i> parentages were possible. Causes might have
miscarried, but results having turned out all right, it would never
do to be too critical about antecedents. Anyhow, Sally was <i>going to
be</i> our daughter, whether she <i>was</i> or not.</p>

<p>Rosalind always found a curious consolation in the reflection that,
however bewildering the position might be, she had it all to
herself. This was entirely apart from her desire to keep Fenwick in
ignorance of his past; that was merely a necessity for his own sake
and Sally's, while this related to the painfulness of standing face
to face with an incredible conjunction of surroundings.

<!-- Page 211 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
She, if
alone, could take refuge in wonder-struck silence. If her knowledge
were shared with another, how could examination and analysis be
avoided? And these would involve the resurrection of what she could
keep underground as long as she was by herself; backed by a thought,
if needed, of the merry eyebrows and pearly teeth, and sweet, soft
youth, of its unconscious result. But to be obliged to review and
speculate over what she desired to forget, and was helped to forget
by gratitude for its consequences, would have been a needless
addition to the burden she had already to bear.</p>

<p>The only person she could get any consolation from talking with was
the Major, who already knew, or nearly knew, the particulars of the
nightmare of twenty years ago. But, then&mdash;we feel that we are
repeating this <i>ad nauseam</i>&mdash;he was quite in the dark about
Fenwick's identity, and was to be kept there. Rosalind had decided
it so, and she may have been right.</p>

<p>Would she have done better by forcing on her husband the knowledge
of his own identity, and risking the shock to her daughter of
hearing the story of her outsider father's sin against her mother?
Her decision against this course was always emphasized by&mdash;may even
have been unconsciously due to&mdash;her prevision of the difficulty of
the communication to Sally. How should she set about it? She
pictured various forms of the attempt to herself, and found none she
did not shudder at.</p>

<p>The knowledge that such things could be would spoil the whole world
for the girl. She had to confess to herself that the customary
paltering with the meaning of words that enables modern novels to be
written about the damnedest things in the universe would either
leave her mind uninformed, or call for a commentary&mdash;a rubric in the
reddest of red letters. Even a resort to the brutal force of
Oriental speech done into Jacobean English would be of little avail.
For hypocrisy is at work all through juvenile reception of Holy
Writ, and brings out as a result the idea that that writ is holy
because it uses coarse language about things that hardly call for
it. It Bowdlerises Potiphar's wife, and favours the impression that
in Sodom and Gomorrah the inhabitants were dissipated and sat up
late. This sort of thing wouldn't work with Sally. If the story were
to be told at all, her thunderbolt directness would have it all out,
down to the ground.

<!-- Page 212 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Her mother went through the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>
again and again, and always came to the same conclusion&mdash;silence.</p>

<p>But for all that, Rosalind had a background belief that a time would
come when a complete revelation would be possible. Her mind
stipulated for a wider experience for Sally before then. It would be
so infinitely easier to tell her tale to one who had herself arrived
at the goal of motherhood, utterly unlike as (so she took for
granted) was to be the way of her arrival, sunlit and soft to tread,
from the black precipice and thorny wastes that had brought her to
her own.</p>

<p>Any possible marriage of Sally's, however, was a vague abstraction
of an indistinct future. Perhaps we should say <i>had been</i>, and admit
that since her own marriage Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick had begun to be more
distinctly aware that her little daughter was now within a
negligible period of the age when her own tree of happiness in life
had been so curtly broken off short, and no new leafage suffered to
sprout upon the broken stem. This identity of age could not but
cause comparison of lots. "Suppose it had been Sally!" was the
thought that would sometimes spring on her mother's mind; and then
the girl would wonder what mamma was thinking of that she should
make her arm that was round her tighten as though she feared to lose
her, or bring her an irrelevant, unanticipated kiss.</p>

<p>This landmark-period bristled with suggested questions of what was
to follow it. Sally would marry&mdash;that seemed inevitable; and her
mother, now that she was herself married again, did not shrink from
the idea as she had done, in spite of her protests against her own
selfishness.</p>

<p>Miss Sally's attitude toward the tender passion did not at present
give any grounds for supposing that she was secretly its victim, or
ever would be. Intense amusement at the perturbation she occasioned
to sensitive young gentlemen seemed to be the nearest approach to
reciprocating their sentiments that she held out any hopes of. She
admitted as a pure abstraction that it was possible to be in love,
but regarded applicants as obstacles that stood in their own way.</p>

<p>"I'm sure his adoration does him great credit," she said to L&aelig;titia
one day about a new devotee&mdash;for there was no lack of them. "But
it's his eyes, and his nose, and his mouth, and his chin,

<!-- Page 213 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
and his
ears, and his hair, and his hands and his feet, and his altogether
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That what?" asked her friend.</p>

<p>"That you can't expect a girl to then, if you insist upon it."</p>

<p>"Some girl will, you'll see, one of these days."</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;even that man with teeth!" This was some chance
acquaintance, useful for illustration, but not in the story. L&aelig;titia
knew enough of him to give a testimonial.</p>

<p>"He's a very good fellow, whatever you may say!" said she.</p>

<p>"My dear Tishy! Goodness is the distinguishing feature of the
opposite sex. I speak as a person of my own. Men's moral qualities
are always high. If it wasn't for their appearance, and their
manners, and their defective intelligences, they would make the most
charming husbands."</p>

<p>"How very young you are!" Miss Wilson said, superior experience
oozing out at every pore. Sally might have passed this by, but when
it came to patting you on the cheek, she drew a line.</p>

<p>"Tishy dear, do you mean to go on like that, when I'm a hundred and
you are a hundred and five?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. At least, I can't say. Anything may have happened by
then."</p>

<p>"What sort of thing? Come, Tishy, don't be enigmatical. For
instance?"</p>

<p>"You'll change your mind and be wiser&mdash;you'll see." Which might have
been consecutive in another conversation. But it was insufferably
patronizing in L&aelig;titia to evade the centenarian forecast that should
have come in naturally, and retreat into a vague abstraction,
managing to make it appear (Sally couldn't say how or why) that her
own general remarks about man, which meant nothing, were a formal
proclamation of celibacy on her part. It is odd how little the mere
wording of a conversation may convey, especially girl's
conversation. What <i>is</i> there in the above to warrant what came next
from Sally?</p>

<p>"If you mean Dr.&nbsp;Vereker, that's ridiculous."</p>

<p>"I never mentioned his name, dear."</p>

<p>"Of course you didn't; you couldn't have, and wouldn't have. But
anybody could tell what you meant, just the same, by leaving your
mouth open when you'd done speaking." We confess

<!-- Page 214 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
freely that we
should not have known, but what are we? Why <i>should</i> L&aelig;titia's
having left her lips slightly ajar, instead of closing them, have
"meant Dr.&nbsp;Vereker"?</p>

<p>But the fact is&mdash;to quote an expression of Sally's own&mdash;brain-waves
were the rule and not the exception with her. And hypnotic
suggestion raged as between her and Miss L&aelig;titia Wilson,
interrupting practice, and involving the performers in wide-ranging,
irrelevant discussion. It was on a musical occasion at Ladbroke
Grove Road that this conversation took place.</p>

<p>L&aelig;titia wasn't going to deny Dr.&nbsp;Vereker, evidently, or else there
really was something very engrossing about her G string. Sally went
on, while she dog's-eared her music, which was new, to get good
turning-over advantages when it came to playing.</p>

<p>"My medical adviser's not bad, taken as an aunt. I don't quite know
what I should do without poor Prosy. But as for anything, of course
that's absurd. Why, half the fun is that there <i>isn't</i> anything!"</p>

<p>L&aelig;titia knew as well as possible that her young friend, once
started, would develop the subject on her own lines without further
help from her. She furnished her face with a faint expression of
amused waiting, not strong enough to be indictable, but operative,
and said never a word.</p>

<p>"Foolery would spoil it all," pursued Sally; "in fact, I put my foot
down at the first go-off. I pointed out that I stipulated to be
considered a chap. Prosy showed tact&mdash;I must say that for
Prosy&mdash;distinctly tact. You see, if I had had to say a single word
to him on the subject, it would have been all up." Then possibly, in
response to a threat of an inflexion in her friend's waiting
countenance, "I should say, when I make use of the expression
'pointed out,' perhaps I ought to say 'conveyed to him.'" Sally gets
the viola in place for a start, and asks is her friend ready?
Waiting, it seems; so she merely adds, "Yes, I should say conveyed
it to him." And off they go with the new piece of music in B flat,
and are soon involved in terrifying complications which have to be
done all over again. At the end, they are ungrateful to B flat, and
say they don't care much for it; it will be better when they can
play it, however. Then L&aelig;titia schemes to wind Sally up a little.</p>

</div>

<p>"Doesn't the Goody goozle at you about him, though? You said she did."</p>

<p>"The Goody&mdash;oh yes! (By-the-bye, mother says I mustn't call your ma
Goody Wilson, or I shall do it to her face, and there'll be a pretty
how-do-you-do.) Prosy's parent broods over one, and gloats as if one
was crumpets; but Prosy himself is very good about her&mdash;aware of her
shortcomings."</p>

<p>"I don't care what you call <i>my</i> mother. Call her any name you like.
But what does Dr.&nbsp;Vereker say?"</p>

<p>"About his'n? Says she's a dear good mother, and I mustn't mind her.
I say, Tishy!"</p>

<p>"What, dear?"</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> the present position of the row? You said your mother.
You know you did&mdash;coming from the bath&mdash;after Henriette went away."</p>

<p>"I did say my mother, dear. But I wish it were otherwise. I've told
Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw so."</p>

<p>"You'd be much nicer if you said Julius. Told him what?"</p>

<p>"Told him a girl can't run counter to the wishes of her family in
practice. Of course, M&mdash;well, then, Julius, if you will have it&mdash;is
ready to wait. But it's really ridiculous to talk in this way, when,
after all, nothing's been said."</p>

<p>"<i>Has</i> nothing?"</p>

<p>"Not <i>to</i> anybody. Only him and me."</p>

<p>"At Riverfordhook?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, what I told you. We needn't go over it again."</p>

<p>"In the avenue. And moonrise and things. What o'clock was it,
please, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"About ten-fifteen, dear. We were in by eleven." This was a faint
attempt to help dignity by a parade of accuracy in figures, and an
affectation of effrontery. "But really we needn't go over it again.
You know what a nice letter he wrote Aunt Frances?" And instead of
waiting for an answer, Tishy, perhaps to avoid catechism about the
moonrise and things, ploughs straight on into a recitation of her
lover's letter to her aunt: "Dear Lady Sales&mdash;Of course it will
(quite literally) give me the <i>greatest possible</i> pleasure to come.
I will bring the Strad"; and then afterwards he said: "I hope your
niece will give a full account of me, and not draw any veils over my
social position. However,

<!-- Page 216 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
this being written at my desk here on the
shop-paper will prevent any misunderstanding."</p>

<p>"Your Aunt Frances has been hatching you&mdash;you two!" says Sally,
ignoring the letter.</p>

<p>"She is a dear good woman, if ever there was one. I wish mamma was
my aunt-by-marriage, and she her!" And then L&aelig;titia went on to tell
many things about the present position of the "row" between herself
and her mother, concerning which it can only be said that nothing
transpired that justified its existence. Seeing that no recognition
was asked for of any formal engagement either by the "young
haberdasher" himself&mdash;for that was the epithet applied to him
(behind his back, of course) by the older lady&mdash;or by the object of
his ambitious aspirations, it might have been more politic, as well
as more graceful, on her part, to leave the affair to die down, as
love-affairs unopposed are so very apt to do. Instead of which she
needs must begin endeavouring to frustrate what at the time of her
first interference was the merest flirtation between a Romeo who was
tied to a desk all day, and a Juliet who was constantly coming into
contact with other potential Romeos&mdash;plenty of them. Our own private
opinion is that if the Montagus and Capulets had tried to bury the
hatchet at a public betrothal of the two young people, the latter
would have quarrelled on the spot. Setting their family circles by
the ears again would almost have been as much fun as a secret
wedding by a friar. You doubt it? Well, we may be wrong. But we are
quite certain that the events which followed shortly after the chat
between the two girls recorded above either would never have come to
pass, or would have taken an entirely different form, if it had not
been for the uncompromising character of Mrs.&nbsp;Sales Wilson's
attitude towards her daughter's Romeo.</p>

<p>We will give this collateral incident in our history a chapter to
itself, for your convenience more than our own. You can skip it, you
see, if you want to get back to Krakatoa Villa.</p>

<p class="subhead">OF JULIUS BRADSHAW'S INNER SOUL. AND OF THE HABERDASHER'S BATTLE AT
LADBROKE GROVE ROAD. ON CARPET STRETCHING, AND VACCINATION FROM THE
CALF. AN AFTER-DINNER INTERVIEW, AND GOOD RESOLUTIONS. EVASIVE
TRAPPISTS</p>

<p>You can remember, if you are male and middle-aged, or worse, some
little incident in your own early life more or less like that
effervescence of unreal passion which made us first acquainted with
Mr.&nbsp;Julius Bradshaw and his violin. Do you shake your head, and deny
it? Are you prepared to look us in the face, and swear you never,
when a young man, had a sleepless night because of some girl whom
you had scarcely spoken to, and who would not have known who you
were if you had been able to master your trepidation and claim
acquaintance; and who, in the sequel, changed her identity, and
became what the greatest word-coiner of our time called a
"speech-friend" of yours, without a scrap of romance or tenderness
in the friendship?</p>

<p>Sally's sudden change of identity from the bewitching little
gardener who had fascinated this susceptible youth, to a merely
uncommonly nice girl, was no doubt assisted by his introduction just
at that moment to the present Mrs.&nbsp;Julius Bradshaw. For it would be
the merest affectation to conceal the ultimate outcome of their
acquaintance.</p>

<p>When Julius came to Krakatoa Villa, he came already half
disillusioned about Sally. What sort of an <i>accolade</i> he expected on
arriving to keep his passion on its legs, Heaven only knows! He
certainly had been chilled by her easy-going invitation to her
mother's. A definite declaration of callous indifference would not
have been half so effective. Sally had the most extraordinary power
of pointing out that she stipulated to be considered as a chap; or
conveying it, which came to the same thing. On the other hand,
L&aelig;titia, who had been freely spoken of by Sally as "making a great
ass of herself about social tommy-rot and

<!-- Page 218 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
people's positions," and
who was aware of the justice of the accusation, had been completely
jerked out of the region of Grundy by Julius's splendid rendering of
Tartini, and had felt disconcerted and ashamed; for Tishy was a
thorough musician at heart. The consequence was an <i>amende
honorable</i> to the young man, on whom&mdash;he having no idea whatever of
its provoking cause&mdash;it produced the effect that might have been
anticipated. Any young lady who wishes to enslave a young man will
really do better work by showing an interest in himself than by any
amount of fascination and allurement, on the lines of Greuze. We are
by no means sure that it is safe to reveal this secret, so do not
let it go any farther. Young women are formidable enough, as it is,
without getting tips from the camp of the enemy.</p>

<p>Anyhow, Sally became a totally different identity to Mr.&nbsp;Julius
Bradshaw. He, for his part, underwent a complete transformation in
hers&mdash;so much so that the vulgar child was on one occasion quite
taken aback at a sudden recollection of his <i>d&eacute;but</i>, and said to her
stepfather: "Only think, Jeremiah! Tishy's Julius is really that
young idiot that came philandering after me Sundays, and I had quite
forgotten it!"</p>

<p>The young idiot had settled down to a reasonable personality; if not
to a manifestation of his actual self, at any rate as near as he was
likely to go to it for some time to come; for none of us ever
succeeds in really showing himself to his fellow-creatures outright.
That's impossible.</p>

<p>Sally had never said very much to her friend of this
pre-introduction phase of Julius&mdash;had, in fact, thought little
enough about it. Perhaps her taking care to say nothing at all of it
in his later phase was her most definite acknowledgment of its
existence at any time. It was only a laughable incident. She saw at
once, when she took note of that sofa <i>s&eacute;ance</i>, which way the cat
was going to jump; and we are bound to say it was a cat that soon
made up its mind, and jumped with decision.</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Sales Wilson's endeavour to intercept that cat had been prompt
and injudicious. She destroyed whatever chance there was of a sudden
<i>volte-face</i> on its part&mdash;and oh, the glorious uncertainty of this
class of cat!&mdash;first by taking no notice of it aggressively, next by
catching hold of its tail, too late. In the art

<!-- Page 219 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
of ignoring
bystanders, she was no match for the cat. And detention seemed only
to communicate impetus.</p>

<p>Julius Bradshaw's first receptions at the Ladbroke Grove House had
been based mainly on his Stradivarius. The Dragon may be said to
have admitted the instrument, but only to have tolerated its owner,
as one might tolerate an organman who owned a distinguished monkey.
Still, the position was an ambiguous one. The Dragon felt she had
made a mistake in not shutting the door against this lion at first.
She had "let him in, to see if she could turn him out again," and
the crisis of the campaign had come over the question whether Mr.
Bradshaw might, or should, or could be received into the inner bosom
of the household&mdash;that is to say, the dinner-bosom. The Dragon said
no&mdash;she drew the line at that. Tea, yes&mdash;dinner, no!</p>

<p>After many small engagements over the question in the abstract, the
plot thickened with reference to the arrangements of a particular
Thursday evening. The Dragon felt that a decisive battle must be
fought; the more so that her son Egerton, whom she had relied on to
back her against a haberdasher, though he might have been useless
against a jockey or a professional cricketer, had gone over to the
enemy, and announced (for the Professor had failed to communicate
the virus of scholarship to this young man) that he was unanimous
that Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw should be forthwith invited to dinner.</p>

<p>His mother resorted to the head of the household as to a Court of
Appeal, but not, as we think, in a manner likely to be effective.
Her natural desire to avenge herself on that magazine of learning
for marrying her produced an unconciliatory tone, even in her
preamble.</p>

<p>"I suppose," she said, abruptly entering his library in the vital
centre of a delectable refutation of an ignoramus&mdash;"I suppose it's
no use looking to you for sympathy in a matter of this sort,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm busy," said the Professor; "wouldn't some other time do as
well?"</p>

<p>"I knew what I had to expect!" said the lady, at once allowing her
desire to embitter her relations with her husband to get the better
of her interest in the measure she desired to pass through
Parliament.

<!-- Page 220 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
She left the room, closing the door after her with
venomous quietness.</p>

<p>The refutation would have to stand over; it was spoiled now, and the
delicious sarcasm that was on his pen's tip was lost irrevocably. He
blotted a sentence in the middle, put his pen in a wet sponge, and
opened his door. He jerked it savagely open to express his attitude
of mind towards interruption. His "<i>What</i> is it?" as he did so was
in keeping with the door-jerk.</p>

<p>"I can speak of nothing to you if you are so <i>tetchy</i>"&mdash;a word said
spitefully, with a jerk explanatory of its meaning. "Another time
will do better, now. I prefer to wait."</p>

<p>When these two played at the domestic game of
exasperate-my-neighbour, the temper lost by the one was picked up by
the other, and added to his or her pack. It was so often her pack
that there must have been an unfair allotment of knaves in it when
dealt&mdash;you know what that means in beggar-my-neighbour? On this
occasion Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson won heavily. It was not every day that she had
a chance of showing her great forbearance and self-restraint, on the
stairs to an audience of a man in leather kneecaps who was laying a
new drugget in the passage, and a model of discretion with a
dustpan, whose self-subordination was beyond praise; her daughter
Athene in the passage below inditing her son Egerton for a
misappropriation of three-and-fivepence; and a faint suspicion of
L&aelig;titia's bedroom door on the jar, for her to listen through, above.</p>

<p>It wasn't fair on the Professor, though; for even before he
exploded, his lady-wife had had ample opportunity of reconnoitring
the battle-field, and, as it were, negotiating with auxiliaries, by
a show of gentle sweetness which had the force of announcement that
she was being misunderstood elsewhere. But she would bear it,
conscious of rectitude. Now, the Professor didn't know there was any
one within hearing; so he snapped, and she bit him <i>sotto voce</i>, but
raised a meek voice to follow:</p>

<p>"Another time will be better. I prefer to wait." This was all the
public heard of her speech. But she went into the library.</p>

<p>"What do you want to speak to me about?" Thus the Professor,
remaining standing to enjoin the temporary character of the
interview; to countercheck which the lady sank in an armchair

<!-- Page 221 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
with
her back to the light. Both she and L&aelig;titia conveyed majesty in
swoops&mdash;filled up <i>fauteuils</i>&mdash;could motion humbler people to take a
seat beside them. "Tishy's Goody runs into skirts&mdash;so does <i>she</i> if
you come to that!" was Sally's marginal note on this point. The
countercheck was effectual, and from her position of vantage the
lady fired her first shot.</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well what I want to speak about." The awkward
part of this was that the Professor did know.</p>

<p>"Suppose I do; go on!" This only improved his position very
slightly, but it compelled the bill to be read a first time.</p>

<p>"Do you wish your daughter to marry a haberdasher?"</p>

<p>"I do not. If I did, I should take her round to some of the shops."</p>

<p>But his wife is in no humour to be jested with. "If you cannot be
serious, Mr.&nbsp;Wilson, about a serious matter, which concerns the
lifelong well-being of your eldest daughter, I am only wasting my
time in talking to you." She threatens an adjournment with a slight
move. Her husband selects another attitude, and comes to business.</p>

<p>"You may just as well say what you have come to say, Roberta. It's
about L&aelig;titia and this young musician fellow, I suppose. Why can't
you leave them alone?" Now, you see, here was a little triumph for
Roberta&mdash;she had actually succeeded in getting the subject into the
realm of discussion without committing herself to any definite
statement, or, in fact, really saying what it was. She could
prosecute it now indirectly, on the lines of congenial contradiction
of her husband.</p>

<p>"I fully expected to be accused of interfering with what does not
concern me. I am not surprised. My daughter's welfare is, it
appears, to be of as little interest to me as it is to her father.
Very well."</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to do? Will you oblige me by telling me what it
is you understand we are talking about?" A gathering storm of
determination must be met, the Dragon decides, by a corresponding
access of asperity on her part. She rises to the occasion.</p>

<p>"I will tell you about what I do <i>not</i> understand. But I do not
expect to be listened to. I do <i>not</i> understand how any father can
remain in his library, engaged in work which cannot possibly be

<!-- Page 222 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
remunerative, while his eldest daughter contracts a disgraceful
marriage with a social inferior." The irrelevance about remuneration
was ill-judged.</p>

<p>"I can postpone the Dictionary&mdash;if that will satisfy you&mdash;and go on
with some articles for the Encyclop&aelig;dia, which pay very well, until
after the ceremony. Is the date fixed?"</p>

<p>"It is easy for you to affect stupidity, and to answer me with
would-be witty evasions. But if you think to deter me from my
duty&mdash;a mother's duty&mdash;by such pitiful expedients you are making a
great mistake. You make my task harder to me, Septimus, but you do
not discourage me. You know as well as I do&mdash;although you choose to
affect the contrary&mdash;that what I am saying does not relate to any
existing circumstances, but only to what may come about if you
persist in neglecting your duty to your family. I came into this
room to ask you to exercise your authority with your daughter
L&aelig;titia, or if not your authority&mdash;for she is over twenty-one&mdash;your
influence. But I see that I shall get no help. It is, however, what
I expected&mdash;no more and no less." And the skirts rustle with an
intention of getting up and going away injured.</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson had a case against her husband, if not a strong one. His
ideas of the duties of a male parent were that he might incur
paternity of an indefinite number of sons and daughters, and
discharge all his obligations to them by providing their food and
education. Having paid quittance, he was at liberty to be absorbed
in his books. Had his payments been large enough to make his wife's
administration of the household easy, he might have been justified,
especially as she, for her part, was not disposed to allow him any
voice in any matter. Nevertheless, she castigated him frightfully at
intervals for not exercising an authority she was not prepared to
permit. He was nothing but a ninepin, set up to be knocked down, an
Aunt Sally who was never allowed to keep her pipe in her mouth for
ten consecutive seconds. The natural consequence of which was that
his children despised him, but to a certain extent loved him; while,
on the other hand, they somewhat disliked their mother, but (to a
certain extent) respected her. It is very hard on the historian and
the dramatist that every one is not quite good or quite bad. It
would make their work so much easier. But

<!-- Page 223 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
it would not be nearly so
interesting, especially in the case of the last-named.</p>

<p>The Professor may have had some feeling on these lines when he
stopped the skirts from rustling out of the apartment by a change in
his manner.</p>

<p>"Tell me seriously what you wish me to do, Roberta."</p>

<p>"I wish you to give attention, if not to the affairs&mdash;<i>that</i> I
cannot expect&mdash;of your household, at least to this&mdash;you may call it
foolish and pooh-pooh it&mdash;business of L&aelig;titia and this young man&mdash;I
really cannot say young gentleman, for it is mere equivocation not
to call him a haberdasher."</p>

<p>The Professor resisted the temptation to criticize some points of
literary structure, and accepted the obvious meaning of this.</p>

<p>"Tell me what he really is."</p>

<p>"I have told you repeatedly. He is nothing&mdash;unless we palter with
the meaning of words&mdash;but a clerk in the office at the stores where
we pay a deposit and order goods on a form. They were originally
haberdashers, so I don't see how you can escape from what I have
said. But I have no doubt you will try to do so."</p>

<p>"How comes he to be such a magnificent violinist? Are they all...?"</p>

<p>"I know what you are going to say, and it's foolish. No, they are
not all magnificent violinists. But you know the story quite well."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do. But now listen. I want to make out one thing. This
young man talked quite freely to me and Egerton about his place, his
position, salary&mdash;everything. And yet you say he isn't a gentleman."</p>

<p>"Of course he isn't a gentleman. I don't the least understand what
you mean. It's some prevarication or paradox." Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson taps the
chair-arm impatiently.</p>

<p>"I mean this&mdash;if he isn't a gentleman, how comes it that he isn't
ashamed of being a haberdasher? Because he <i>isn't</i>. Seemed to take
it all as a matter of course."</p>

<p>"I cannot follow your meaning at all. And I will not trouble you to
explain it. The question now is&mdash;will you, or will you not, <i>do</i>
something?"</p>

<p>"Has the young gentleman?"&mdash;Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson snorted audibly&mdash;"Well,

<!-- Page 224 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
has
this young haberdasher made any sort of definite declaration to
L&aelig;titia?"</p>

<p>"I understand not. But it's impossible not to see."</p>

<p>"Would it not be a little premature for me to say anything to him?"</p>

<p>"Have I asked you to do so?"</p>

<p>"I am a little uncertain what it is you have asked me to do."</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson contrived, by pantomime before she spoke, to express her
perfect patience under extremest trial, inflicted on her by an
impudent suggestion that she hadn't made her position clear. She
would, however, state her case once more with incisive distinctness.
To that end she separated her syllables, and accented selections
from them, even as a resolute hammer accents the head of a nail.</p>

<p>"Have I not told you dis<i>tinct</i>ly"&mdash;the middle syllable of this word
was a sample nailhead&mdash;"a <i>thou</i>sand times that what I wish you to
do&mdash;however much you may shirk doing it&mdash;is to <i>speak</i> to
L&aelig;titia&mdash;to remonstrate with her about the encouragement she is
giving to this young man, and to <i>point out</i> to her that a girl in
her position&mdash;in short, the duties of a girl in her position?" Mrs.
Wilson's come-down at this point was an example of a solemn warning
to the elocutionist who breaks out of bounds. She was obliged to
fall back arbitrarily on her key-note in the middle of the
performance. "Have I said this to you, Mr.&nbsp;Wilson, or have I not?"</p>

<p>"Speaking from memory I should say <i>not</i>. Yes&mdash;certainly <i>not</i>. But
I can raise no reasonable objection to speaking to L&aelig;titia, provided
I am at liberty to say what I like. I understand that to be part of
the bargain."</p>

<p>"If you mean," says the lady, whose temper had not been improved by
the first part of the speech; "if you mean that you consider
yourself at liberty to encourage a rebellious daughter against her
mother, I know too well from old experience that that is the case.
But I trust that for once your right feeling will show you that it
is your <i>plain duty</i> to tell her that the course she is pursuing can
only lead to the loss of her position in society, and probably to
poverty and unhappiness."</p>

<p>"I can tell her you think so, of course," says the Professor, drily.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 225 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"I will say no more"&mdash;very freezingly. "You know as well as I do
what it is your <i>duty</i> to say to your daughter. What you will
<i>decide</i> to say, I do <i>not</i> know." And premonitory rustles end in a
move to the door.</p>

<p>"You can tell her to come in now&mdash;if you like." The Professor won't
show too vivid an interest. It isn't as if the matter related to a
Scythian war-chariot, or a gold ornament from a prehistoric tomb, or
<i>vari&aelig; lectiones</i>.</p>

<p>"At least, Septimus," says the apex of the departing skirts, "you
will remember what is due to yourself and your family&mdash;<i>I</i> am
nobody&mdash;so far as not to encourage the girl in resisting her
mother's authority." And, receiving no reply, departs, and is heard
on the landing rejecting insufficient reasons why the drugget will
not lay flat. And presently issuing a mandate to an upper landing:</p>

<p>"Your father wishes to speak to you in his library. <i>I</i> wish you to
go." The last words not to seem to abdicate as Queen Consort.</p>

<p>L&aelig;titia isn't a girl whom we find new charms in after making her
mother's acquaintance. You know how some young people would be
passable enough if it were not for a lurid light thrown upon their
identity by other members of their family. You know the sister you
thought was a beauty and dear, until you met her sister, who was
gristly and a jade. But it's a great shame in Tishy's case, because
we do honestly believe her seeming <i>da capo</i> of her mother is more
skirts than anything else. We credit their respective <i>apices</i> with
different dispositions, although (yes, it's quite true what you say)
we don't see exactly from what corner of the Professor's his
daughter got her better one. He's all very well, but....</p>

<p>Anyhow, we are sorry for Tishy now, as she comes uneasily into the
library to be "spoken to." She comes in buttoning a glove and
saying, "Yes, papa." She was evidently just going out&mdash;probably
arrested by the voices in the library.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, your mother wishes me to speak to you.... H'm! h'm!
By-the-bye," he interrupts himself, "it really is a very
extraordinary thing, but it's just like work-people. A man spends
all his life laying carpets, and the minute he lays mine it's too
big or too small."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 226 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"The man outside? He's very tiresome. He says the passage is an
unusual size."</p>

<p>"I should have taken that point when I measured it. It seems to me
late in the day now the carpet's made up. However, that's neither
here nor there. Your mother wishes me to&mdash;a&mdash;to speak to you, my
dear."</p>

<p>"What does she want you to say, papa?"</p>

<p>"H'm&mdash;well!&mdash;it's sometimes not easy to understand your mother. I
cannot say that I have gathered precisely what it is she wishes me
to say. Nor am I certain that I should be prepared to say it if I
knew what it was."&mdash;Tishy brightened perceptibly.&mdash;"But I am this
far in sympathy with what I suppose to be her meaning"&mdash;Tishy's face
fell&mdash;"that I should be very sorry to hear that you had made any
binding promises to any young gentleman without knowing more of his
antecedents and connexions than I suppose you do at the present
about this&mdash;a&mdash;musical friend of yours&mdash;without consulting me." The
perfunctory tone in which he added, "and your mother," made the
words hardly worth recording.</p>

<p>But perhaps the way they, in a sense, put the good lady out of
court, helped to make her daughter brighten up again. "Dear papa,"
she said, "I should never dream for one moment of doing such a
thing. Nor would Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw dream of asking me to do so."</p>

<p>"That's quite right, my dear&mdash;quite enough. Don't say anything more.
I am not going to catechize you." And Tishy was not sorry to hear
this, because her disclaimer of a binding promise was only true in
the letter. In fact, our direct Sally had only the day before
pounced upon her friend with, "You know perfectly well he's kissed
you heaps of times!" And Tishy had only been able to begin an
apology she was not to be allowed to finish with, "And suppose he
has...?"</p>

<p>However, her sense of an untruthfulness that was more than merely
technical was based not so much on the bare fact of a
kissing-relation having come about, as upon a particular example.
She knew it was the merest hypocrisy to make believe that the climax
of that interview at Riverfordhook, where there were the moonrise
and things, did not constitute a pledge on the part of both.
However, Tishy is not the first young lady, let me tell you&mdash;if

<!-- Page 227 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
you
don't know already&mdash;who has been guilty of equivocation on those
lines. It is even possible that her father was conniving at it, was
intentionally accepting what he knew to be untrue, to avoid the
trouble of further investigation, and to be able to give his mind to
the demolition of that ignoramus. A certain amount of fuss was his
duty; but the sooner he could find an excuse to wash his hands of
these human botherations and get back to his inner life the better.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a sense of chill at the suspicion that her father was
not concerned enough about her welfare that made L&aelig;titia try to
arrest his retirement into his inner life. Or it may have been that
she was sensitive, as young folk are, at her new and strange
experience of Real Love, and at the same time grated on&mdash;scraped the
wrong way&mdash;in her harsh collision with her mother, who was showing
Cupid no quarter, and was only withheld from overt acts of hostility
to Julius Bradshaw by the knowledge that excess on her part would
precipitate what she sought to avert.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause was, her momentary sense of relief that her
father was not going to catechize her was followed by a feeling that
she almost wished he would. It would be so nice to have a natural
parent that was really interested in his daughter's affairs. Poor
Tishy felt lonely, and as if she was going to cry. She must unpack
her heart, even if it bored papa, who she knew wanted to turn her
out and write. She broke down over it.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa&mdash;papa! Indeed, I want to do everything you wish&mdash;whatever
you tell me. I <i>will</i> be good, as we used to say." A sob grew in her
throat over this little nursery recollection. "Only&mdash;only&mdash;only&mdash;it
isn't really quite true about no promises. We haven't made them, you
know, but they're <i>there</i> all the same." Tishy stops suddenly to
avoid a sob she knows is coming. A pocket-handkerchief is called in
to remove tears surreptitiously, under a covering pretence of a less
elegant function. The Professor hates scenes worse than poison, and
Tishy knows it.</p>

<p>"There, there! Well, well! Nothing to cry about. <i>That's</i> right."
This is approval of the disappearance of the
pocket-handkerchief&mdash;some confusion between cause and effect,
perhaps. "Come, my child&mdash;come, L&aelig;titia&mdash;suppose now you tell me all
about it."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 228 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>

<p>Tishy acknowledges to herself that she desires nothing better. Yes,
papa dear, she will, indeed she will, tell him everything. And then
makes a very fair revelation of her love-affair&mdash;a little dry and
stilted in the actual phrasing, perhaps, but then, what can you
expect when one's father is inclined to be stiff and awkward in such
a matter, to approach it formally, and consider it an interview? It
was all mamma's fault, of course. Why should she be summoned before
the bar of the house? Why couldn't her father find his way into her
confidence in the natural current of events? However, this was
better than nothing.</p>

<p>Besides, we softened gradually as we developed the subject. One of
us, who was Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw at first, became Julius later, with a
strong lubricating effect. We began with sincere attachment, but we
loved each other dearly before we had done. We didn't know when "it"
began exactly&mdash;which was a fib, for we were perfectly well aware
that "it" began that evening at Krakatoa Villa, which has been
chronicled herein&mdash;but for a long time past Julius had been asking
to be allowed to memorialise the Professor on the subject.</p>

<p>"But you know, papa dear, I couldn't say he was to speak to you
until I was quite certain of myself. Besides, I did want him to be
on better terms with mamma first."</p>

<p>Professor Wilson flushed angrily, and began with a knitted brow, "I
wish your mother would&mdash;&mdash;" but stopped abruptly. Then, calming
down: "But you are quite certain <i>now</i>, my dear L&aelig;titia?" Oh dear,
yes; no doubt of that. And how about Julius? The confident ring of
the girl's laugh, and her "Why, you should hear him!" showed that
she, at least, was well satisfied of her lover's earnestness.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear child," said the Professor, who was beginning to feel
that it was time to go back to his unfinished ignoramus, tyro, or
sciolist; "I tell you what I shall do. When's he coming next?
Thursday, to dinner. Very well. I shall make a little opportunity
for a quiet talk with him, and we shall see."</p>

<p>The young lady came out of the library on the whole comfortabler
then she had entered it, and finished buttoning that glove in the
passage. As she stood reflecting that papa would really be very nice
if he would shave more carefully&mdash;for the remains of his adieu was
still rasping her cheek&mdash;she was aware of

<!-- Page 229 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the voice of the carpet;
she heard it complain, through the medium of its layer, or
stretcher, who seemed to mean to pass the remainder of his days
scratching the head of perplexity on the scene of his recent failure
to add to his professional achievements.</p>

<p>"It's what I say to the guv'nor"&mdash;thus ran his Jeremiad&mdash;"in dealin'
with these here irregular settin's out, where nothin's not to say
parallel with anything else, nor dimensions lendin' theirselves to
accommodation. 'Just you let me orfer it in,' I says 'afore the
final stitchin' to, or even a paper template in extra cases is a
savin' in the end,' Because it stands to reason there goes more
expense with an ill-cut squint or obtoose angle, involvin' work to
rectify, than cut ackerate in the first go-off. Not but what ruckles
may disappear under the tread, only there's no reliance to be
placed. You may depend on it, to make a job there's nothin' like
careful plannin', and foresight in the manner of speakin'. And, as I
say to the guv'nor, there's no need for a stout brown-paper template
to go to waste, seein' it works in with the under-packin'." And much
more which Tishy could still hear murmuring on in the distance as
she closed the street door and fled to an overdue appointment with
Sally, into whose sympathetic ear she could pour all her new records
of the progress of the row.</p>

<p>To tell the whole of the prolonged pitched battle that ensued would
take too much ink and paper. The Dragon fought magnificently, so
long as she had the powerful backing of her married daughter, Mrs.
Sowerby Bagster, and the skirmishing help of Athene. This latter
was, however, not to be relied on&mdash;might go over to the enemy any
moment. Mrs.&nbsp;Bagster, or Clarissa, who was an elder sister of
L&aelig;titia's, became lukewarm, too, on a side-issue being raised. It
did not appear to connect itself logically with the bone of
contention, having reference entirely to vaccination from the calf.
But it led to an exaggerated sensitiveness on her part as to the
responsibility we incurred by interference with what might (after
all) be the Will of Providence. If this should prove so, it would be
our duty not to repine. Clarissa contrived to surround the subject
with an unprovoked halo of religious meekness, and to work round to
the conclusion that it would be presumptuous not to ask Mr.
Bradshaw

<!-- Page 230 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
to dinner. Only this resulted absolutely and entirely from
her refusing to have her three children all vaccinated from the calf
forthwith, because their grandmother thought it necessary. The
latter, finding herself deserted in her hour of need by a powerful
ally&mdash;for three whole children had given Clarissa a deep insight
into social ethics, and a weighty authority&mdash;surrendered grudgingly.
She tried her best to make her invitation to dinner take the form of
leave to come to dinner, and partly succeeded. Her suggestions that
she hoped Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw would understand the rules of the game at the
table of Society caused the defection of her remaining confederate,
Athene, who turned against her, exclaiming: "He won't eat with his
knife, at any rate!" However, it was too late to influence current
events. The battle was fought and over.</p>

<p>The obnoxious young man didn't eat with his knife when he came, with
docility, a day after he received the invitation. Remember, he
appears originally in this story as a chosen of Cattley's, one
warranted to defy detection by the best-informed genteelologist. He
went through his ordeal very well, on the whole, considering that
Egerton (from friendship) was always on the alert to give him tips
about civilised conduct, and that Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson called him nearly
every known dissyllabic name with <i>A</i>'s in it&mdash;Brathwaite, Palgrave,
Bradlaugh, Playfair, and so on, but not Bradshaw. She did this the
more as she never addressed him directly, treating him without
disguise as the third-person singular in a concrete form. This was
short-sighted, because it stimulated her husband to a tone of
civility which would probably have risen to deference if the good
lady had not just stopped short of insult.</p>

<p>Egerton and the only other male guest (who was the negative young
pianist known to Sally as Somebody Elsley) having found it
convenient to go away at smoking-time to inspect the latter's
bicycle, the Professor seized his opportunity for conversation with
the third-person-singular. He approached the subject abruptly:</p>

<p>"Well, it's L&aelig;titia, I understand, that we're making up to, eh?"
Perhaps it was this sudden conversion to the first person plural
that made the young man blush up to the roots of his hair.</p>

</div>

<p>"What can I say?" he asked hesitatingly. "You see, Professor Wilson,
if I say yes, it will mean that I have been p-paying my addresses,
as the phrase is...."</p>

<p>"And taking receipts?"</p>

<p>"Exactly&mdash;and taking receipts, without first asking her father's
leave. And if I say no&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you say no, my dear young man, her father will merely ask you to
help yourself and pass the port (decanter with the little brass
ticket&mdash;yes, that one. Thank you!). Well, I see what you mean, and
we needn't construct enigmas. We really get to the point. Now tell
me all about it." We don't feel at all sure the Professor's way of
getting to the point was not a good one. You see, he had had a good
deal to do with young men in early academical phases of
existence&mdash;tutorships and the like&mdash;and had no idea of humming and
hawing and stuttering over their affairs. Besides, it was best for
Bradshaw, as was shown by the greater ease with which he went on
speaking, and began telling the Professor all about it.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be speaking truthfully, sir, if I were to pretend
things haven't gone a little beyond&mdash;a little beyond&mdash;the exact
rules. But you've no idea how easily one can deceive oneself."</p>

<p>"Haven't I?" The Professor's mind went back to his own youth. He
knew very well how easily he had done it. A swift dream of his past
shot through his brain in the little space before Bradshaw resumed.</p>

<p>"Well, it was only a phrase. Of course you know. I mean it has all
crept on so imperceptibly. And I have had no real chance of talking
about it&mdash;to <i>you</i>, sir&mdash;without asking for a formal interview. And
until very lately nothing L&aelig;t&mdash;Miss Wilson...."</p>

<p>"Tut-tut! L&aelig;titia&mdash;L&aelig;titia. What's the use of being prigs about it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing L&aelig;titia has said would have warranted me in doing this. I
<i>could</i> have introduced the subject to Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson once or twice,
but...."</p>

<p>"All right. I understand. Well, now, what's the exact state of
things between you and L&aelig;titia?"</p>

<p>"You will guess what our wishes are. But we know quite well

<!-- Page 232 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
that
their fulfilment is at present impossible. It may remain so. I have
no means at present except a small salary. And my mother and
sister&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have a claim on you&mdash;is that it?" The Professor's voice seems to
forestall a forbidding sound. But he won't be in too great a hurry.
He continues: "You must have some possibility in view, some sort of
expectation."</p>

<p>Bradshaw's reply hesitated a good deal.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;allowed myself to fancy&mdash;that, in
short, I might be able to&mdash;outgrow this unhappy nervous affection."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"I know what you mean, Professor Wilson. You mean that a violinist's
position, however successful, would be less than you have a right to
expect for your daughter's husband. Of course that is so, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I mean nothing of the sort." The Professor is abrupt and
decisive, as one who repudiates. "I know nothing about positions.
However, Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw, you are quite right this far&mdash;that is what
Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson would have meant. <i>She</i> knows about positions. What <i>I</i>
meant was that you wouldn't have enough to live upon at the best, in
any comfort, and that I shouldn't be able to help you. Suppose you
had a large family, and the nervous affection came back?" His hearer
quakes at this crude, unfeeling forecast of real matrimonial facts.
He and L&aelig;titia fully recognise in theory that people who marry incur
families; but, like every other young couple, would prefer a veil
drawn over their particular case. The young man flinches visibly at
the Professor's needlessly savage hypothesis of disasters. Had he
been a rapid and skilful counsel in his own behalf, he would have at
once pounced on a weak point, and asked how many couples would ever
get married at all, if we were to beg and borrow every trouble the
proper people (whoever they are) are ready to give away and lend. He
can only look crestfallen, and feel about in his mind for some way
of saying, "If I wanted L&aelig;titia to promise to marry me, that would
apply. As matters stand, it is not to the purpose," without seeming
to indite the Professor for prematureness. Of course, the position
had been created entirely by the Dragon. Why could she not have

<!-- Page 233 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
let
them alone, as her husband had said to her? Why not, indeed?</p>

<p>But Master Julius has to see his way out into the open, and he is
merely looking puzzled, and letting a very fair cigar out&mdash;and, you
know, they are never the same thing relighted. Perhaps what he does
is as good as anything else.</p>

<p>"I see you are right, sir, and I am afraid I am to blame&mdash;I must
be&mdash;because my selfish thoughtlessness, or whatever it ought to be
called, has placed us in a position out of which no happiness can
result for either?" He looks interrogatively into the Professor's
gold spectacles, but sees no relaxation in the slightly knitted brow
above them. Their owner merely nods.</p>

<p>"But you needn't take all the blame to yourself," he says. "I've no
doubt my daughter is entitled to her share of it"&mdash;to which Bradshaw
tries to interpose a denial&mdash;"only it really doesn't matter whose
fault it is."</p>

<p>The disconcerted lover, who felt all raw, public, and uncomfortable,
wondered a little what the precise "it" was that could be said to be
any one's fault. After all, he and L&aelig;titia were just two persons
going on existing, and how could it be any concern of any one else's
what each thought of or felt for the other? It is true he lacked
absolution for the kissing transgressions; they were blots on a
clean sheet of mere friendship. But would the Dragon be content that
he and L&aelig;titia should continue to see each other if they signed a
solemn agreement that there was to be no kissing? You see, he was
afraid he was going to be cut off from his lady-love, and he didn't
like the looks of the Professor. But he didn't propose the drawing
up of any such compact. Perhaps he didn't feel prepared to sign it.
However, he was to be relieved from any immediate anxiety. The
Professor had never meant to take any responsibility, and now that
he had said his say, he only wanted to wash his hands of it.</p>

<p>"Now, understand me, Bradshaw," said he&mdash;and there was leniency and
hope in the dropped "Mr."&mdash;"I do not propose to do more than advise;
nor do I know, as my daughter is twenty-four, what I can do except
advise. We won't bring authority into court.... Oh yes, no doubt
L&aelig;titia believes she will never act against my wishes. Many girls
have thought that sort of thing. But&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped dead, with a
little side-twist of the

<!-- Page 234 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
head, and a lip-pinch, expressing doubt,
then resumed: "So I'll give you my advice, and you can think it
over. It is that you young people just keep out of each other's way,
and let the thing die out. You've no idea till you try what a
magical effect absence has; poetry is all gammon. Take my advice,
and try it. Have some more port? No&mdash;thank me! Then let's go
upstairs."</p>

<p>Upstairs were to be found all the materials for an uncomfortable
evening. A sort of wireless telegraphy that passed between Bradshaw
and L&aelig;titia left both in low spirits. They did not rise (the
spirits) when the Professor said, to the public generally, "Well, I
must say good-night, but <i>you</i> needn't go," and went away to his
study; nor when his Dragon followed him, with a strong flavour of
discipline on her. For thereupon it became necessary to ignore
conflict in the hinterland of some folding-doors, accompanied by
sounds of forbearance and a high moral attitude. There was no remedy
but music, and as soon as Bradshaw got at his Stradivarius the mists
seemed to disperse. The <i>adagio</i> of Somebody's quartette No. 101
seemed to drive a coach-and-six through mortal bramble-labyrinths.
But as soon as it ceased, the mists came back all the thicker for
being kept waiting. And the outcome of a winding-up interview
between the sweethearts was the conclusion that after what had been
said by the father of one of them, it was necessary that all should
be forgotten, and be as though it had never been. And the gentleman
next day, when he showed himself at his desk at Cattley's, provoked
the remark that Paganini had got the hump this morning&mdash;which shows
that his genius as a violinist was recognised at Cattley's.</p>

<p>As for the lady, we rather think she made up her mind in the course
of the night that if her family were going to interfere with her
love-affairs, she would let them know what it was to have people
yearning for other people in the house. For she refused boiled eggs,
eggs and bacon, cold salmon-trout, and potted tongue at breakfast
next day, and left half a piece of toast and half a cup of tea as a
visible record that she had started pining, and meant to do it in
earnest.</p>

<p>What L&aelig;titia and Julius suffered during their self-inflicted
separation, Heaven only knows! This saying must be interpreted as
meaning that nobody else did. They were like evasive Trappist

<!-- Page 235 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
monks, who profess mortification of the flesh, but when it comes to
the scratch, don't flog fair. Whatever they lost in the cessation of
uncomfortable communion at the eyrie, or lair, of the Dragon was
more than made up for by the sub-rosaceous, or semi-clandestine,
character of the intercourse that was left. Stolen kisses are
notoriously sweetest, but when, in addition to this, every one is
actually the very last the shareholders intend to subscribe for,
their fascination is increased tenfold. And every accidental or
purely unintentionally arranged meeting of these two had always the
character of an interview between people who never meet&mdash;which, like
most truths, was only false in exceptional cases; and in this
instance these were numerous. Factitious absence of this sort will
often make the heart grow fonder, where the real thing would make it
look about for another; and another is generally to be found.</p>

<p>It might have been unsafe to indulge in speculation, based on the
then <i>status quo</i>, as to when the inevitable was going to happen. We
know all about it now, but that doesn't count. Stories, true or
false, should be told consecutively.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="subhead">IT WAS THAT MRS. NIGHTINGALE'S FAULT. A SATISFACTORY CHAP, GERRY! A
TELEGRAM AND A CLOUD. BRONCHITIS AND ASTHMA AND FOG. SALLY GOES TO
MAYFAIR. THE OLD SOLDIER HAS NOTICE TO&nbsp;QUIT</p>

<p>The most deeply-rooted instinct of mankind is the one that prompts
it to lay the blame on some one else. Mankind includes womankind,
and woman includes (for we believe she is still living) the Dragon
of the last chapter. As it did not occur to this good lady that her
own attitude of estrangement from L&aelig;titia had anything to answer for
in the rash and premature development of the latter's love-affair,
she cast about for a scapegoat, and found one in the person of
Rosalind Fenwick. Some one had schemed the whole business, clearly,
and who else could it be but that woman? Of course, L&aelig;titia herself
was simply the victim of a plot&mdash;she was young and inexperienced;
people's daughters are.</p>

<p>But nothing in the nefarious business had escaped the watchful eye
of the Dragon. At the time of the very first appearance of "that
Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale" on the scene she had pointed out her insidious
character, and forewarned North and North-west Kensington of what
was to be expected from a person of her antecedents. It was true no
one knew anything about these latter; but, then, that was exactly
the point.</p>

<p>"It's useless attempting to find excuses for that woman. Clarissa,"
she had said. "It's always the same story with people of that sort.
Whenever they have no proper introduction, they always turn out
schemers and matchmakers. I detected her, and said so at once. It is
easy for your father to pretend he has forgotten. He always does. My
consolation is that I did my duty. And then, of course, it all turns
out as I said. Anybody could have known what sort of person she was
with half an eye!"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 237 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"And what sort of person is she?" asked Clarissa coldly. She had not
forgotten the vaccination from the calf.</p>

<p>"The sort of person you would expect. Unless, Clarissa, you are
going to take a leaf out of your father's book, and make believe you
do not understand what is transparently on the surface. What
interest can Major Roper have in inventing the story, I should like
to know?"</p>

<p>"How does he come to know so much about it? Who told him?"</p>

<p>"Who <i>told</i> him? Why, of course that very old gentleman&mdash;what's his
name?&mdash;<i>you</i> know&mdash;&mdash;" Mrs.&nbsp;Wilson tries if she can't recollect with
a quick vibration of a couple of fingers to back up her brain.
"Colonel Dunn!"</p>

<p>"Major Lund?"</p>

<p>"Lunn or Dunn. Yes, I remember now; it's Lunn, because the girl said
when she was a child she thought Sally Lunns had something to do
with both. You may depend on it, I'm right. Well, Major Roper's his
most intimate friend. They belong to the same club."</p>

<p>The ladies then lost sight of their topic, which lapsed into a
rather heated discussion of whether the very old gentleman was a
Colonel or a Major. As we don't want to hear them on this point, we
may let them lapse too.</p>

<p>It may have been because of some home anxieties&mdash;notably about the
Major, whose bronchitis had been bad&mdash;that Rosalind Fenwick
continued happily unconscious of having incurred any blame or taken
any responsibility on herself in connexion with the Ladbroke Grove
row, as Sally called it. If she <i>had</i> known of it, very likely it
would not have troubled her, for she was really too contented with
her own condition and surroundings to be concerned about externals.
Whatever troubles she had were connected with the possibility, which
always seemed to grow fainter, of a revival of her husband's powers
of memory. Sometimes whole weeks would pass without an alarm.
Sometimes some little stirring of the mind would occur twice in the
same day; still, the tendency seemed to be, on the whole, towards a
more and more complete oblivion.</p>

<p>But the fact is that so long as she had the Major invalided at
Krakatoa Villa (for he was taken ill there, and remained on her
hands

<!-- Page 238 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
many weeks before he could return to his lodgings) she had the
haziest impressions of the outside world. Sally talked about "the
row" while they were nursing the old boy, but really she heeded her
very little. Then, when the invalid was so far reinstated that he
was fit to be moved safely, Sally went away too, for a change.</p>

<p>The respite to old Colonel Lund was not to be for long. But the
rest, alone with her husband, was not unwelcome to Rosalind.</p>

<p>"I can never have been one-tenth as happy, Rosey darling," said he
to her one day, "as I have been in the last six months. I should
recollect all about it if I had."</p>

<p>"You're a satisfactory chap to deal with, Gerry&mdash;I must say that for
you. You always beam, come what may. Even when you fly out&mdash;which
you do, you know&mdash;it's more like a big dog than a wasp. You were
always...." Now, Rosalind was going to say "always like that"; it
was a mistake she was constantly in danger of. But she stopped in
time, and changed her speech to "You're not without your faults, you
know! You never can come to an anchor, and be quiet. You sit on the
arms of chairs, and your hands are too big and strong. No; you
needn't stop. Go on!" We like leaving the words to elucidate the
concurrent action. "And you don't smell much of tobacco."</p>

<p>Fenwick, however, had noticed the kink in the thread, and must needs
wind it back to get a clear line. "I was always what?" said he. His
wife saw a way out.</p>

<p>"Always good when your daughter was here to manage you." It wasn't
so satisfactory as it might have been, but answered in dealing with
a mind so unsuspicious. Sally's having spent Christmas and stayed on
a little at a friend's in the country lent plausibility to a past
tense which might else have jarred.</p>

<p>"I don't want the kitten all to myself, you know," said Fenwick. "It
wouldn't be fair. After all, she <i>was</i> yours before she was mine."</p>

<p>There was not a tremor in the hand that lay in his, the one that was
not caressing her cheek; not a sign of flinching in the eyes that
turned round on him; not a trace of hesitation in the voice that
said, with concession to a laugh in it: "Yes, she <i>was</i> mine before
she was yours." Such skill had grown in this life of
nettle-grasping!&mdash;indeed, she hardly felt the sting now. This time

<!-- Page 239 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
she was able to go on placidly, in the unconnected way of talk books
know not, and life well knows:</p>

<p>"Do you know what the kitten will be next August?"</p>

<p>"Yes; twenty-one."</p>

<p>"It's rather awful, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Which way do you mean? It's awful because she isn't <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, or
awful because she might be at any minute?"</p>

<p>"You've picked up her way of going to the point, Gerry. I never said
anything about her being <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>."</p>

<p>"No, but you meant it."</p>

<p>"Of course I did! Well, then, because she might be any minute. I'm
very glad she <i>isn't</i>. Why, you know I <i>must</i> be!"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> am, anyhow!"</p>

<p>"Just think what the house would be without her!"</p>

<p>"The best place in the world still for me." She acknowledges this by
a kiss on his hairy hand, which he returns <i>via</i> her forehead; then
goes on: "All the same, I'll be hanged if I know what we should do
without our kitten. But has anything made you afraid?"</p>

<p>"Oh no; nothing at all! Certainly; no, nothing. Have <i>you</i> noticed
anything?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no! For anything I can see, she may continue a&mdash;a sort of
mer-pussy to the end of time." Both laugh in a way at the name he
has made for her; then he adds: "Only...."</p>

<p>"Only what?"</p>

<p>"Nothing I could lay hold of."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether you're thinking of the same thing as I am?" Very
singularly, it does not seem necessary to elucidate the point. They
merely look at each other, and continue looking as Fenwick says:</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> a funny couple, if that's it!"</p>

<p>"They certainly <i>are</i>," she replies. "But I <i>have</i> thought so, for
all that!" And then both look at the fire as before, this being, of
course, in the depth of winter. Rosalind speaks next.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about <i>him</i>, of course! But the chick would have
told me at once if...."</p>

<p>"If there had been anything to tell. No doubt she would."</p>

<p>"Of course, it's absurd to suppose he could see so much of her as he
does, and not...."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 240 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Perfectly absurd! But then, you know, that young fiddler was very
bad, indeed, about the chick until he made her acquaintance."</p>

<p>"So he was." Thoughtfully, as one who weighs.</p>

<p>"The kitten met him with a sort of stony geniality that would have
knocked the heart out of a Romeo. If Juliet had known the method,
she could have nipped Shakespeare in the bud."</p>

<p>"She <i>didn't</i> want to. Sally <i>did</i>."</p>

<p>"But then Shakespeare might have gone on and written a dry
respectable story&mdash;not a love-story; an esteem story&mdash;about how
Juliet took an interest in Romeo's welfare, and Romeo posted her
letters for her, and presented her with a photograph album, and so
on. And how the families left cards."</p>

<p>"But it isn't exactly stony geniality. It's another method
altogether with the doctor&mdash;a method the child's invented for
herself."</p>

<p>Fenwick repeats, "A method she's invented for herself. Exactly.
Well, we shall have her back to-morrow. What time does she come?"
And then her mother says, interrupting the conversation: "What's
that?"</p>

<p>"What's what?"</p>

<p>"I thought I heard the gate go."</p>

<p>"Not at this time of night." But Fenwick is wrong, for in a moment
comes an imperious peal at the bell. A pair of boots, manifestly on
a telegraph-boy's cold feet, play a devil's tattoo on the sheltered
doorstep. They have been inaudible till now, as the snow is on the
ground again at Moira Villas. In three minutes the boots are
released, and they and their wearer depart, callously uninterested
in the contents of the telegram they have brought. If we were a
telegraph-boy, we should always be yearning to know and share the
joys and sorrows of our employers. This boy doesn't, to judge by the
way he sings that he is "Only the Ghost of a Mother-in-law," showing
that he goes to the music-halls.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Less than ten minutes after the telegraph-boy has died away in the
distance Rosalind and her husband are telling a cab to take them to
174, Ball Street, Mayfair.</p>

<div>

</div>

<p>It does so grudgingly, because of the state of the roads. It wants
three-and-sixpence, and gets it, for the same reason. But it doesn't
appear to be drawn by a logical horse who can deal with inferences,
because it is anxious to know when its clients are going back, that
it may call round for them.</p>

<p>For the telegram was that there was "no cause immediate
apprehension; perhaps better come&mdash;Major." As might have been
expected from such a telegram about a man of his age, just after
seeming recovery from an attack of bronchitis, the hours on earth of
its subject were numbered. Fever may abate, temperature may be
brought down to the normal, the most nourishing possible nourishment
may be given at the shortest possible intervals, but the recoil of
exhaustion will have its way when there is little or nothing left to
exhaust. Colonel Lund had possibly two or three years of natural
life before him, disease apart, when a fierce return of the old
enemy, backed by the severity of a London winter, and even more
effectually by its fog, stopped the old heart a few thousand beats
too soon, and ended a record its subject had ceased to take an
interest in a few paragraphs short of the normal <i>finis</i>.</p>

<p>We allow our words to overtake our story in this way because we know
that you know&mdash;you who read&mdash;exactly what follows telegrams like the
one that came to Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick. If you are new and young, and do not
know it yet, you will soon. However, we can now go back.</p>

<p>When the economical landlady (a rather superior person) who had
opened the street-door was preceding Rosalind up the narrow stairs,
and turning up gas-jets from their reserve of darkness-point, she
surprised her by saying she thought there was the Major coming
downstairs. "Yes, madam; the Major&mdash;Major Roper," she continued, in
reply to an expression of astonishment. Rosalind had forgotten that
Colonel Lund was, outside her own family, "the Colonel."</p>

<p>It was Major Roper whom we have seen at the Hurkaru Club, as purple
as ever and more asthmatic&mdash;in fact, the noise that was the Major
coming downstairs was also the noise of the Major choking in the
fog. It came slowly down, and tried hard to stop, in order that its
source might speak intelligibly to the visitors. What time the
superior person stood and grudged the gas.

<!-- Page 242 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
In the end, speech of a
sort was squeezed out slowly, as the landlady, stung to action by
the needless gas-waste, plucked the words out of the speaker's mouth
at intervals, and finished them up for him. The information came
piecemeal; but in substance it was that he had the day before found
his old friend coughing his liver up in this dam fog, and had taken
on himself to fetch the medical man and a nurse; that these latter,
though therapeutically useless, as is the manner of doctors and
nurses, had common-sense enough to back him (Roper) in his view that
Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick ought to be sent for, although the patient opposed
their doing so. So he took upon himself to wire. There wasn't any
occasion whatever for alarm, ma'am! Not the slightest. "You hear me,
and mark what I say&mdash;an old stager, ma'am! Ever such a little
common-sense, and half the patients would recover!" A few details of
the rapid increase of the fever, of the patient's resistance to the
sending of his message, and an indication of a curious feeling on
the old Colonel's part that it wouldn't be correct form to go back
to be nursed through a second attack when he had so lately got safe
out of the first one. All this landed the speaker in something near
suffocation, and made his hearers protest, quite uselessly, against
his again exposing himself to the fog. Whereon the landlady, with a
finger on the gas-tap, nodded toward the convulsed old officer to
supply her speech with a nominative, and spoke. What she said was
merely: "Hasn't been to bed." And then waited for Rosalind to go
upstairs with such aggressive patience that the latter could only
say a word or two of thanks to Major Roper and pass up. He, for his
part, went quicker downstairs to avoid the thanks, and the gas-tap
vigil came to a sudden end the moment Rosalind turned the handle of
the door above.... Now, what is the object of all this endless
detail of what might have been easily told in three words&mdash;well, in
thirty, certainly?</p>

<p>Simply this: to show you why Fenwick, following on after some
discussion with the cab below, was practically invisible to the
asthmatic one, who passed him on the stairs just as the light above
vanished. So he had no chance of recognizing the donor of his
tiger's skin, which he might easily have done in open day, in spite
of the twenty years between, for the old chap was

<!-- Page 243 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
as sharp as a
razor about people. He passed Fenwick with a good-evening, and Mr.
Fenwick, he presumed, and his good lady was on ahead, as indicated
by the speaker's thumb across his shoulder. Fenwick made all
acknowledgments, and felt his way upstairs in the dark till the
nurse with a hand-lamp looked over the banisters for him.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>When Sally came back to Krakatoa Villa early next day she found an
empty house, and a note signed Jeremiah that explained its
emptiness. We had been sent for to the Major, and Sally wasn't to be
frightened. He had had a better night than last night, the doctor
and nurse said; and Sally might come on as soon as she had had a
good lunch. Only she was on no account to fidget.</p>

<p>So she didn't fidget. She had the good lunch very early, left Ann to
put back her things in the drawers, and found her way through the
thickening fog to the Tube, only just anxious enough about the Major
to feel, until the next station was Marble Arch, that London had
changed and got cruder and more cold-hearted since she went away,
and that the guard was chilly and callous about her, and didn't care
how jolly a house-party she had left behind her at Riverfordhook.
For it was that nice aunt of Tishy's that had asked her down for a
few days, and the few days had caught on to their successors as they
came, and become a fortnight. But he appeared to show a human heart,
at least, by a certain cordiality with which he announced the
prospect of Marble Arch, which might have been because it was
Sally's station. Now, he had said Lancaster Gate snappishly, and
Queen's Road with misgiving, as though he would have fain added D.V.
if the printed regulations had permitted it. Also, Sally thought
there was good feeling in the reluctance he showed to let her out,
based entirely on nervousness lest she should slip (colloquially)
between the platform.</p>

<p>You don't save anything by taking the pink 'bus, nor any 'bus for
that matter, down Park Lane when the traffic tumbles down every
half-minute, in spite of cinders lavished by the authority, and
can't really see its way to locomotion when it gets up. So you may
just as well walk. Sally did so, and in ten minutes reached the
queer little purlieu teeming with the well-connected,

<!-- Page 244 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
and named
after the great Mysteries they are connected with, that lies in the
angle of Park Lane and Piccadilly. Persons of exaggerated sense of
locality or mature hereditary experience can make short cuts through
this district, but the wayfarer (broadly speaking) had better not
try, lest he be found dead in a mews by the Coroner, and made the
subject of a verdict according to the evidence. Sally knew all about
it of old, and went as straight through the fog as the ground-plan
of the streets permitted to the house where her mother and a nurse
were doing what might be done to prolong the tenancy of the
top-floor. But both knew the occupant had received notice to quit.
Only, it did seem so purposeless, this writ of ejectment and violent
expulsion, when he was quite ready to go, and wanted nothing but
permission.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF A FOG THAT WAS UP-TO-DATE, AND HOW A FIRE-ENGINE RELIEVED SALLY
FROM A BOY. HOW SALLY GOT IN AT A GENTLEMEN'S CLUB, AND HOW VETERANS
COULD RECOLLECT HER FATHER. BUT THEY KNOW WHAT SHE CAN BE TOLD, AND
WHAT SHE CAN'T. HOW MAJOR ROPER WOULD GO OUT IN THE&nbsp;FOG</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick was not sorry to break down a little, now that her
daughter had come to break down on. She soon pulled together,
however. Breaking down was not a favourite relaxation of hers, as we
have seen. Her husband had, of course, left her to go to his place
of business, not materially the worse for a night spent without
closed eyes and in the anxiety of a sick-chamber.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother darling! you are quite worn out. How is he?"</p>

<p>"He's quiet now, kitten; but we thought the cough would have killed
him in the night. He's only so quiet now because of the opiates.
Only at his age&mdash;&mdash;" Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick stopped and looked at the nurse,
whose shake of the head was an assent to the impossibility of
keeping a patient of eighty alive on opiates. Then, having gone thus
far in indicating the grim probabilities of the case, Sally's mother
added, as alleviation to a first collision with Death: "But Dr.
Mildmay says the inflammation and fever may subside, and then, if he
can take nourishment&mdash;&mdash;" but got no further, for incredulity of
this sort of thing is in the air of the establishment.</p>

<p>Not, perhaps, on Sally's part. Young people who have not seen Death
face-to-face have little real conception of his horrible unasked
intrusion into the house of Life. That house is to them almost as
inviolable as the home of our babyhood was to the most of us, a
sacred fane under the protection of an omnipotent high-priest and
priestess&mdash;papa and mamma. Almost as inviolable, that is, when those
who live in it are our friends. Of course, the people in the
newspapers go dying&mdash;are even killed in railway accidents. This
frame of mind will change for Sally when she

<!-- Page 246 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
has seen this patient
die. For the time being, she is half insensible&mdash;can think of other
things.</p>

<p>"What did the party mean that let me in, mother darling? The fusty
party? She said she thought it was the Major. I didn't take any
notice till now. I wanted to get up."</p>

<p>"It was the other Major, dear&mdash;Major Roper. Don't you know? <i>He</i>
used to talk of him, and say he was an old gossip." In the dropped
voice and the stress on the pronoun one can hear how the speaker's
mind knows that the old Colonel is almost part of the past. "But
they were very old friends. They were together through the Mutiny.
<i>He</i> was his commanding officer." Sally's eyes rest on the old sabre
that hangs on its hook in the wall, where she has often seen it,
ranking it prosaically with the other furnishings of "the Major's"
apartment. Now, a new light is on it, and it becomes a reality in a
lurid past, long, long before there was any Sally. A past of
muzzle-loading guns and Mini&eacute; rifles, of forced marches through a
furnace-heat to distant forts that hardly owned the name, all too
late to save the remnant of their defenders; a past of a hundred
massacres and a thousand heroisms; a past that clings still, Sally
dear, about the memory of us oldsters that had to know it, as we
would fain that no things that are, or are to be, should ever cling
about yours. But you have read the story often, and the tale of it
grows and lives round the old sabre on the wall.</p>

<p>Except as an explanation of the fusty party's reference to a Major,
Old Jack&mdash;that was Sally's Major's name for him&mdash;got very little
foothold in her mind, until a recollection of her mother's allusion
to him as an old gossip having made her look for a suitable image to
place there, she suddenly recalled that it was he that had actually
seen her father; talked to him in India twenty years ago; could, and
no doubt would, tell her all about the divorce. But there!&mdash;she
couldn't speak to him about it here and now. It was impossible.</p>

<p>Still, she was curious to see him, and the fusty but genteel one had
evidently expected him. So, during the remainder of what seemed to
Sally the darkest day, morally and atmospherically, that she had
ever spent&mdash;all but the bright morning when she ran into the fog
somewhere near Surbiton, full of tales to tell of the house-party
that now seemed a happy dream&mdash;during this gloomy

<!-- Page 247 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
remainder Sally
wondered what could have happened that the other Major should not
have turned up. The fog would have been more than enough to account
for any ordinary non-appearance; hardly for this one.</p>

<p>For it turned out, as soon as it got full powers to assert itself,
the densest fog on record. The Londoner was in his element. He told
the dissatisfied outsider with pride of how at midday it had been
impossible to read large pica on Ludgate Hill; he didn't say why he
tried to do so. He retailed frightful stories&mdash;but always with a
sense of distinction&mdash;of folk crushed under hoofs and cart-wheels.
If one half were true, some main thoroughfares must have been paved
with flattened pedestrians. The satisfaction he derived from the
huge extra profits of the gas-companies made his hearer think he
must be a shareholder, until <i>pari passu</i> reasoning proved him to
have invested in fog-signals. His legends of hooligans preying on
the carcasses of strangled earls undisturbed had a set-off in others
of marauders who had rushed into the arms of the police and thought
them bosom friends; while that of an ex-Prime Minister who walked
round and round for an hour, and then rang at a house to ask where
he was, ended in consolation, as the door was opened by his own
footman, who told him he wasn't at home. Exact estimates were
current, most unreasonably, of the loss to commerce; so much so that
the other Londoner corrected him positively with, "Nearer
three-quarters of a million, they say," and felt proud of his higher
knowledge. But neither felt the least ashamed, nor the least afraid
of the hideous, inevitable future fog, when a suffocated population
shall find, as it surely will, that it is at the bottom of a sea of
unbreathable air, instead of one that merely makes it choke its
stomach up and kills an old invalid or two. On the contrary, both
regarded it as the will of a judicious Providence, a developer of
their own high moral qualities and a destroyer of their germs.</p>

<p>Bronchitis and asthma are kittle-cattle to shoe behind, even where
the sweet Mediterranean air blows pure upon Rapallo and Nervi, but
what manner of cattle are they in a London fog? Can they be shoed at
all? As Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick sits and waits in terror to hear the first
inevitable cough as the old man wakes, and talks in whispers to her
daughter in the growing darkness, she

<!-- Page 248 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
feels how her own breath
drags at the tough air, and how her throat resents the sting of the
large percentage of sulphur monoxide it contains. The gas-jet is on
at the full&mdash;or rather the tap is, for the fish-tail burner doesn't
realise its ideal. It sputters in its lurid nimbus&mdash;gets bronchitis
on its own account, tries to cough its tubes clear and fails. Sally
and her mother sit on in the darkness, and talk about it, shirking
the coming suffocation of their old friend, and praying that his
sleep may last till the deadly air lightens, be it ever so little.
Sally's animated face shows that she is on a line of cogitation, and
presently it fructifies.</p>

<p>"Suppose every one let their fires out, wouldn't the fog go? It
couldn't go on by itself."</p>

<p>"I don't know, chick. I suppose it's been all thought out by
committees and scientific people. Besides, we should all be frozen."</p>

<p>"Not if we went to bed."</p>

<p>"What! In the daytime?"</p>

<p>"Better do nothing in bed than be choked up."</p>

<p>"I dare say the fog wouldn't go away. You see, it's due to
atmospheric conditions, so they say."</p>

<p>"That's only because nobody's there to stop 'em talking nonsense.
Look at all that smoke going up our chimney." So it was, and a jolly
blaze there was going to be when the three shovelfuls Sally had
enthusiastically heaped on had incubated, and the time was ripe for
the poker.</p>

<p>Had you been there you would have seen in Sally's face as it caught
the firelight-flicker and pondered on the cause of the fog, that
<i>she</i> had not heard a choking fit of the poor old sleeper in the
next room. And in her mother's that she <i>had</i>, and all the memory of
the dreadful hours just passed. Her manner, too, was absent as she
talked, and she listened constantly. Sally was to know what it was
like soon. The opium sleep would end.</p>

<p>"Isn't that him?" The mother's sharp ear of apprehension makes her
say this; the daughter has not heard the buried efforts of the lung
that cannot cough. It will succeed directly, if the patient is
raised up, so. Both have gone quickly and quietly into the
sick-chamber, and it is the nurse who speaks. Her prediction

<!-- Page 249 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
is
fulfilled, and the silent struggle of suffocation becomes a tearing
convulsion, that means to last some while and does it. How the old,
thin tenement of life can go on living unkilled is a problem to
solve. But it survives this time. Perhaps the new cough-mixture will
make the job easier next time. We shall see.</p>

<p>Anyhow, this attack&mdash;bad as it was&mdash;has not been so bad as the one
he had at three this morning. Rosalind and Nurse Emilia invent a
paroxysm of diabolical severity, partly for the establishment of a
pinnacle for themselves to look down on Sally from, partly for her
consolation. He wasn't able to speak for ever so long after that,
and this time he is trying to say something.... "What is it, dear?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't we have a window open to let a little air in?"</p>

<p>Well!&mdash;we could have a window open. We could let a little air
in&mdash;but only a very little. And that very little would bring with it
copious percentages of moisture saturated with finely subdivided
carbonaceous matter, of carbon dioxide, and sulphur dioxide, and
traces of hydric chloride, who is an old friend of our youth, known
to us then as muriatic acid.</p>

<p>"It's such a thick fog, Major dear. As soon as it clears a little
we'll open the window. Won't we, Sally?"</p>

<p>"Is Sally there?... Come and touch my hand, kitten.... That's
right...." What is left of the Major can still enjoy the plump
little white hand that takes the old fingers that once could grasp
the sword that hangs on the wall. It will not be for very long now.
A newspaper paragraph will soon give a short record of all the
battles that sword left its scabbard to see, and will tell of its
owner's service in his later days as deputy Commissioner at
Umritsur, and of the record of long residence in India it
established, exceeding that of his next competitor by many years.
Not a few old warriors that were in those battles, and many that
knew his later time, will follow him beyond it very soon. But he is
not gone yet, and his hand can just give back its pressure to
Sally's, as she sits by him, keeping her heart in and her tears
back. The actual collapse of vital forces has not come&mdash;will not
come for a few days. He can speak a little as she stoops to hear
him.</p>

<p>"Young people like you ought to be in bed, chick, getting
beauty-sleep.

<!-- Page 250 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
You must go home, and make your mother go.... <i>You</i>
go. <i>I</i> shall be all right...."</p>

<p>"It isn't night, Major dear"&mdash;Sally makes a paltry attempt to
laugh&mdash;"it's three in the afternoon. It's the fog." But she cannot
hear what he says in answer to this, go close as she may. After a
pause of rest he tries again, with raised voice:</p>

<p>"Roper&mdash;Roper&mdash;Old Jack ... mustn't come ... asthma in the fog ...
somebody go to stop him." He is quite clear-headed, and when Sally
says she will go at once, he spots the only risk she would run,
being young and healthy:</p>

<p>"Sure you can find your way? Over the club-house&mdash;Hurkaru Club&mdash;&mdash;"
And then is stopped by a threat of returning cough.</p>

<p>But Sally knows all about it, and can find her way anywhere&mdash;so she
says. She is off in a twinkling, leaving her mother and the nurse to
wait for the terrible attack that means to come, in due course, as
soon as the new cough-mixture gets tired.</p>

<p>Sally is a true Londoner. <i>She</i> won't admit, whoever else does, that
a fog is a real evil. On the contrary, she inclines to Prussian
tactics&mdash;flies in the face of adverse criticism with the decision
that a fog is rather a lark when you're out in it. Actually face to
face with a human creature choking, Sally's optimism had wavered. It
recovers itself in the bracing atmosphere of a main-thoroughfare
charged to bursting with lines of vehicles, any one of which would
go slowly alone, but the collective slowness of which finds a vent
in a deadlock a mile away&mdash;an hour before we can move, we here.</p>

<p>By what human agency it comes about that any wheeled vehicle drawn
of horses can thunder at a hand-gallop through the matrix of such a
deadlock, Heaven only knows! But the glare of the lamps of the
fire-brigade, hot upon the wild excitement of their war-cry, shows
that this particular agglomeration of brass and copper, fraught with
suppressed energy of steam well up, means to try for it&mdash;seems to
have had some success already, in fact. It quite puts Sally in
spirits&mdash;the rapid <i>crescendo</i> of the hissing steam, the gleaming
boiler-dome that might be the fruitful mother of all the helmets
that hang about her skirts, the sudden leaping of the whole from the
turgid opacity behind and equally sudden disappearance into the void
beyond, the vanishing "Fire!" cry from which all consonants have
gone, leaving only a sound

<!-- Page 251 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
of terror, all confirm her view of the
fog as a lark. For, you see, Sally believed the Major might pull
through even now.</p>

<p>Also the coming of the engine relieved her from what threatened to
become a permanent embarrassment. A boy, who may have been a good
boy or may not, had attached himself to her, under pretext of either
a strong organ of locality or an extensive knowledge of town.</p>

<p>"Take yer 'most anywhere for fourpence! Anywhere yer like to name.
'Ammersmith, 'Ackney Wick, Noo Cross, Covent Garden Market, Regency
Park. Come, I say, missis!"</p>

<p>Sally shouldn't have shaken her head as she did. She ought to have
ignored his existence. He continued:</p>

<p>"I don't mind makin' it thruppence to the Regency Park. Come,
missis, I say! Think what a little money for the distance. How would
<i>you</i> like to do it yourself?" Sally rashly allowed herself to be
led into controversy.</p>

<p>"I tell you I don't want to go to Regents Park." But the boy passed
this protest by&mdash;ignored it.</p>

<p>"You won't get no better oarfer. You ask any of the boys. They'll
tell you all alike. Regency Park for thruppence. Or, lookey here
now, missis! You make it acrorst Westminster Bridge, and I'll say
twopence-'a'penny. Come now! Acrorst a bridge!" This boy had quite
lost sight of the importance of selecting a destination with
reference to its chooser's life-purposes, in his contemplation of
the advantages of being professionally conducted to it. Sally was
not sorry when the coming of the fire-engine distracted his
attention, and led to his disappearance in the fog.</p>

<p>Pedestrians must have been stopping at home to get a breath of fresh
air indoors, as the spectres that shot out of the fog, to become
partly solid and vanish again in an instant, seemed to come always
one at a time.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me, sir"&mdash;Sally is addressing a promising spectre, an
old gentleman of sweet aspect&mdash;"have I passed the Hurkaru Club?" The
spectre helps an imperfect hearing with an ear-covering outspread
hand, and Sally repeats her question.</p>

<p>"I hope so, my dear," he says, "I hope so. Because if you haven't, I
have. I wonder where we are. What's this?" He pats a building at its
reachable point&mdash;a stone balustrade at a step

<!-- Page 252 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
corner. "Why, here we
are! This is the Club. Can I do anything for you?"</p>

<p>"I want Major Roper"&mdash;and then, thinking more explanation asked for,
adds&mdash;"who wheezes." It is the only identification she can recall
from Tishy's conversation and her mother's description. She herself
had certainly seen their subject once from a distance, but she had
only an impression of something purple. She could hardly offer that
as identification.</p>

<p>"Old Jack! He lives in a kennel at the top. Mulberry, tell Major
Roper lady for him. Yes, better send your card up, my dear; that's
right!"</p>

<p>By this time they are in a lobby full of fog, in which electric
light spots are showing their spiritless nature. Mulberry, who is
like Gibbon the historian painted in carmine (a colour which clashes
with his vermilion lappets), incites a youth to look sharp; also, to
take that card up to Major Roper. As the boy goes upstairs with it
two steps at a time Sally follows the old gentleman into a great
saloon with standing desks to read skewered journals on and is
talking to him on the hearthrug. She thinks she knows who he is.</p>

<p>"I came to stop Major Roper coming round to see <i>our</i> Major&mdash;Colonel
Lund, I mean. It isn't fit for him to come out in the fog."</p>

<p>"Of course, it isn't. And Lund mustn't come out at his age. Why,
he's older than I am.... What? Very ill with bronchitis? I heard
he'd been ailing, but they said he was all right again. Are you his
Rosey?"</p>

<p>"No, no; mamma's that! She's more the age, you know. I'm only
twenty."</p>

<p>"Ah dear! how one forgets! Of course, but he's bad, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"He's very bad. Oh, General Pellew&mdash;because I know it's you&mdash;his
cough is so dreadful, and there's no air for him because of this
nasty fog! Poor mamma's there, and the nurse. I ought to hurry back;
but he wanted to prevent Major Roper coming round and getting worse
himself; so we agreed for me to come. I'll just give my message and
get back."</p>

<p>"Your mamma was Mrs.&nbsp;Graythorpe. I remember her at Umballa years
ago. I know; she changed her name to Nightingale.

<!-- Page 253 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
She is now
Mrs...?" Sally supplied her mother's married name. "And you,"
continued Lord Pellew, "were Baby Graythorpe on the boat."</p>

<p>"Of course. You came home with Colonel Lund; he's told me about
that. Wasn't I a handful?" Sally is keenly interested.</p>

<p>"A small handful. You see, you made an impression. I knew you
before, though. You had bitten me at Umballa."</p>

<p>"He's told me about that, too. Isn't that Major Roper coming now?"
If it is not, it must be some one exactly like him, who stops to
swear at somebody or something at every landing. He comes down by
instalments. Till the end of the last one, conversation may
continue. Sally wants to know more about her <i>trajet</i> from India&mdash;to
take the testimony of an eyewitness. "Mamma says always I was in a
great rage because they wouldn't let me go overboard and swim."</p>

<p>"I couldn't speak to that point. It seems likely, though. I always
want to jump overboard now, but reason restrains me. You were not
reasonable at that date."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> funny, though, that I have got so fond of swimming since.
I'm quite a good swimmer."</p>

<p>Major Roper is by this time manifest volcanically at the bottom of
the staircase, but before he comes in Lord Pellew has time to say so
is his nasturtium granddaughter a good swimmer. He has thirteen, and
has christened each of them after a flower. He hopes thirteen isn't
unlucky, and then Major Roper comes in apologetic. Sally can just
recollect having seen him before, and thinks him as purple as ever.</p>

<p>"Lund&mdash;er!&mdash;Lund&mdash;er!&mdash;Lund&mdash;er!&mdash;Lund," he begins; each time he
says the name being baffled by a gasp, but holding tight to Sally's
hand, as though to make sure of her staying till he gets a chance.
He gets none, apparently, for he gives it up, whatever he was going
to say, with the hand, and says instead, in a lucky scrap of
intermediate breath: "I was comin' round&mdash;just comin'&mdash;only no
gettin' those dam boots on!" And then becomes convulsively involved
in an apology for swearing before a young lady. She, for her part,
has no objection to his damning his boots if he will take them off,
and not go out. This she partly conveys, and then, after a too
favourable brief report of the patient's state&mdash;inevitable under the
circumstances&mdash;she continues:</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 254 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"That's what I came on purpose to say, Major Roper. You're not to
come out on any account in the fog. Colonel Lund wouldn't be any
better for your coming, because he'll think of you going back
through the fog, and he'll fret. Please do give up the idea of
coming until it clears. Besides, he isn't my grandfather." An
inconsecutive finish to correct a mistake of Old Jack's. She resumes
the chair she had risen from when he came in, and thereupon he,
suffering fearfully from having no breathing-apparatus and nothing
to use it on, makes concession to a chair himself, but all the while
waves a stumpy finger to keep Sally's last remark alive till his
voice comes. The other old soldier remains standing, but somewhat on
Sally's other side, so that she does not see both at once. A little
voice, to be used cautiously, comes to the Major in time.</p>

<p>"Good Lard, my dear&mdash;excuse&mdash;old chap, you know!&mdash;why, good Lard,
what a fool I am! Why, I knoo your father in India."</p>

<p>But he stops suddenly, to Sally inexplicably. She does not see that
General Pellew has laid a finger of admonition on his lips.</p>

<p>"I never saw my father," she says. It is a kind of formula of hers
which covers all contingencies with most people. This time she does
not want it to deadlock the conversation, which is what it usually
serves for, so she adds: "You really knew him?"</p>

<p>"Hardly knoo," is the reply. "Put it I met him two or three times,
and you'll about toe the line for a start. Goin' off at that, we
soon come up to my knowin' the Colonel's not your grandfather."
Major Roper does not get through the whole of the last word&mdash;asthma
forbids it&mdash;but his meaning is clear. Only, Sally is a direct Turk,
as we have seen, and likes clearing up things.</p>

<p>"You know my friend L&aelig;titia Wilson's mother, Major Roper?" The Major
expresses not only that he does, but that his respectful homage is
due to her as a fine woman&mdash;even a queenly one&mdash;by kissing his
finger-tips and raising his eyes to heaven. "Well, L&aelig;titia (Tishy, I
call her) says you told her mother you knew my father in India, and
went out tiger-hunting with him, and he shot a tiger two hundred
yards off and gave you the skin." Sally lays

<!-- Page 255 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
stress on the two
hundred yards as a means of identification of the case. No doubt the
Major owned many skins, but shot at all sorts of distances.</p>

<p>It is embarrassing for the old boy, because he cannot ignore General
Pellew's intimations over Sally's head, which she does not see. He
is to hold his tongue&mdash;that is their meaning. Yes, but when you have
made a mistake, it may be difficult to begin holding it in the
middle. Perhaps it would have been safer to lose sight of the
subject in the desert of asthma, instead of reviving it the moment
he got to an oasis.</p>

<p>"Some misunderstanding'," said he, when he could speak. "I've got a
tiger-skin the man who shot it gave me out near Nagpore, but he
wasn't your father." How true that was!</p>

<p>"Do you remember his name?" Sally wants him to say it was Palliser
again, to prove it all nonsense, but a warning finger of the old
General makes him desperate, and he selects, as partially true, the
supposed alias which&mdash;do you remember all this?&mdash;he had ascribed to
the tiger-shooter in his subsequent life in Australia.</p>

<p>"Perfectly well. His name was Harrisson. A fine shot. He went away
to Australia after that."</p>

<p>Sally laughs out. "How very absurd of Tishy!" she says. "She hadn't
even got the name you said right. <i>She</i> said it was Palliser. It
sounds like Harrisson." She stopped to think a minute. "But even if
she had said it right it wouldn't be my father, because his name,
you know, was Graythorpe&mdash;like mine before we both changed to
Nightingale&mdash;mother and I. We did, you know."</p>

<p>Old Jack assents to this with an expenditure of breath not warranted
where breath is so scarce. He cannot say "of course," and that he
recollects, too often. Perhaps he is glad to get on a line of
veracity. The General says "of course," also. "Your mother, my dear,
was Mrs.&nbsp;Graythorpe when I knew her at Umballa and on the boat."
Both these veterans call Sally "my dear," and she doesn't resent it.</p>

<p>But her message is really given, and she ought to get back. She
succeeds in finally overruling Major Roper's scheme of coming out
into the fog, which has contrived to get blacker still during this
conversation; but has more trouble with the other old soldier.

<!-- Page 256 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
She
only overcomes that victor in so many battle-fields by representing
that if he does see her safe to Ball Street <i>she</i> will be miserable
if she doesn't see <i>him</i> safe back to the club. "And then," she
adds, "we shall go on till doomsday. Besides, I <i>am</i> young and
sharp!" At which the old General laughs, and says isn't <i>he</i>? Ask
his granddaughters! Sally says no, he isn't, and she can't have him
run over to please anybody. However, he will come out to see her
off, though Old Jack must do as he's told, and stop indoors. He
watches the little figure vanish in the fog, with a sense of the
merry eyebrows in the pretty shoulders, like the number of a cab
fixed on behind.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>When General Pellew had seen Sally out, to the great relief of
Gibbon of the various reds in the lobby, he returned and drew a
chair for himself beside Major Roper, who still sat, wrestling with
the fog, where he had left him.</p>

<p>"What a dear child!... Oh yes; she'll be all right. Take better care
of herself than I should of her. She would only have been looking
after me, to see that I didn't get run over." He glanced round and
dropped his voice, leaning forward to the Major. "She must never be
told."</p>

<p>"You're right, Pelloo! Dam mistake of mine to say! I'm a dam
mutton-headed old gobblestick! No better!" We give up trying to
indicate the Major's painful interruptions and struggles. Of course,
he might have saved himself a good deal by saying no more than was
necessary. General Pellew was much more concise and to the purpose.</p>

<p>"<i>Never</i> be told. I see one thing. Her mother has told her little or
nothing of the separation."</p>

<p>"No! Dam bad business! Keep it snug's the word."</p>

<p>"You saw she had no idea of the name. It <i>was</i> Palliser, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Unless it was Verschoyle." Major Roper only says this to convince
himself that he might have forgotten the name&mdash;a sort of washy
palliation of his Harrisson invention. It brings him within a
measurable distance of a clear conscience.</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't Verschoyle. I remember the Verschoyle case." By this
time Old Jack is feeling quite truthful. "It <i>was</i> Palliser, and
it's not for me to blame him. He only did what you or

<!-- Page 257 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
I might have
done&mdash;any man. A bit hot-headed, perhaps. But look here, Roper...."</p>

<p>The General dropped his voice, and went on speaking almost in a
whisper, but earnestly, for more than a minute. Then he raised it
again.</p>

<p>"It was that point. If you say a word to the girl, or begin giving
her any information, and she gets the idea you can tell her more,
she'll just go straight for you and say she must be told the whole.
I can see it in her eyes. And <i>you can't tell her the whole</i>. You
know you can't!"</p>

<p>The Major fidgeted visibly. He knew he should go round to learn
about his old friend (it was barely a quarter of a mile) as soon as
the least diminution of the fog gave him an excuse. And he was sure
to see Sally. He exaggerated her age. "The gyairl's twenty-two,"
said he weakly. The General continued:</p>

<p>"I'm only speaking, mind you, on the hypothesis.... I'm supposing
the case to have been what I told you just now. Otherwise, you could
work the telling of it on the usual lines&mdash;unfaithfulness, estranged
affections, desertion&mdash;all the respectable produceable phrases. But
as for making that little Miss Nightingale <i>understand</i>&mdash;that is,
without making her life unbearable to her&mdash;it can't be done, Major.
It can't be done, old chap!"</p>

<p>"I see your game. I'll tell her to ask her mother."</p>

<p>"It can't be done that way. I hope the child's safe in the fog." The
General embarked on a long pause. There was plenty of time&mdash;more
time than he had (so his thought ran) when his rear-guard was cut
off by the Afridis in the Khyber Pass. But then the problem was not
so difficult as telling this live girl how she came to be
one&mdash;telling her, that is, without poisoning her life and shrouding
her heart in a fog as dense as the one that was going to make the
street-lamps outside futile when night should come to help
it&mdash;telling her without dashing the irresistible glee of those
eyebrows and quenching the smile that opened the casket of pearls
that all who knew her thought of her by.</p>

<p>Both old soldiers sat on to think it out. The older one first
recognised the insolubility of the problem. "It can't be done," said
he. "Girls are not alike. She's too much like my nasturtium
granddaughter now...."</p>

<p>"I shall have to tell her dam lies."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 258 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"That won't hurt you, Old Jack."</p>

<p>"I'm not complainin'."</p>

<p>"Besides, I shall have to tell 'em, too, as likely as not. You must
tell me what you've told, so as to agree. I should go round to ask
after Lund, only I promised to meet an old thirty-fifth man here at
five. It's gone half-past. He's lost in the fog. But I can't go away
till he comes." Old Jack is seized with an unreasoning sanguineness.</p>

<p>"The fog's clearin'," he says. "You'll see, it'll be quite bright in
half-an-hour. Nothin' near so bad as it was, now. Just you look at
that window."</p>

<p>The window in question, when looked at, was not encouraging. So far
as could be seen at all through the turgid atmosphere of the room,
it was a parallelogram of solid opacity crossed by a window-frame,
with a hopeless tinge of Roman ochre. But Old Jack was working up to
a fiction to serve a purpose. By the time he had succeeded in
believing the fog was lifting he would be absolved from his promise
not to go out in it. It was a trial of strength between credulity
and the actual. The General looked at the window and asked a
bystander what he thought, sir? Who felt bound to testify that he
thought the prospect hopeless.</p>

<p>"You're allowin' nothin' for the time of day," said Major Roper, and
his motive was transparent. Sure enough, after the General's friend
had come for him, an hour late, the Major took advantage of the
doubt whether absolute darkness was caused by fog or mere night, and
in spite of all remonstrances, began pulling on his overcoat to go
out. He even had the effrontery to appeal to the hall-porter to
confirm his views about the state of things out of doors. Mr.
Mulberry added his dissuasions with all the impressiveness of his
official uniform and the cubic area of its contents. But even his
powerful influence carried no weight in this case. It was useless to
argue with the infatuated old boy, who was evidently very uneasy
about Major Lund, and suspected also that Miss Nightingale had not
reported fair, in order to prevent him coming. He made himself into
a perfect bolster with wraps, and put on a respirator. This damned
thing, however, he took off again, as it impeded respiration, and
then went out into the all but solid fog, gasping and choking
frightfully, to feel his way

<!-- Page 259 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
to Hill Street and satisfy himself the
best thing was being done to his old friend's bronchitis.</p>

<p>"They'll kill him with their dam nostrums," said he to the last
member of the Club he spoke to, a chance ex-Secretary of State for
India, whom he took into his confidence on the doorstep. "A little
common-sense, sir&mdash;that's what's wanted in these cases. It's all
very fine, sir, when the patient's young and can stand it...." His
cough interrupted him, but he was understood to express that medical
attendance was fraught with danger to persons of advanced years, and
that in such cases his advice should be taken in preference to that
of the profession. He recovered enough to tell Mulberry's
subordinate to stop blowin' that dam whistle. There were cabs enough
and to spare, he said, but they were affecting non-existence from
malicious motives, and as a stepping-stone to ultimate rapacity.
Then he vanished in the darkness, and was heard coughing till he
turned a corner.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="subhead">HOW MAJOR ROPER MET THAT BOY, AND GOT UPSTAIRS AT BALL STREET. AN
INTERVIEW BETWEEN ASTHMA AND BRONCHITIS. HOW SALLY PINIONED THE
PURPLE VETERAN, AND THERE WAS NO BOY. HOW THE GOVERNOR DONE
HOARCKIN', AND GOT QUALIFIED FOR A SUBJECT OF PSYCHICAL RESEARCH</p>

<p>Old Jack's powers of self-delusion were great indeed if, when he
started on his short journey, he really believed the fog had mended.
At least, it was so dense that he might never have found his way
without assistance. This he met with in the shape of a boy with a
link, whom Sally at once identified from his description, given when
the Major had succeeded in getting up the stairs and was resting in
the sitting-room near the old sabre on the wall, wiping his eyes
after his effort. Colonel Lund was half-unconscious after a bad
attack, and it was best not to disturb him. Fenwick had not
returned, and no one was very easy about him. But every one affirmed
the reverse, and joined in a sort of Creed to the effect that the
fog was clearing. It wasn't and didn't mean to for some time. But
the unanimity of the creed fortified the congregation, as in other
cases. No two believers doubted it at once, just as no two Alpine
climbers, strung together on the moraine of a glacier, lose their
foothold at the same time.</p>

<p>"I know that boy," said Sally. "His nose twists, and gives him a
presumptuous expression, and he has a front tooth out and puts his
tongue through. Also his trousers are tied on with strings."</p>

<p>"Everlastin' young beggar, if ever there was one," says the old
soldier, in a lucid interval when speech is articulate. But he is
allowing colloquialism to run riot over meaning. No everlasting
person can ever have become part of the past if you think of it. He
goes on to say that the boy has had twopence and is to come back for
fourpence in an hour, or threepence if you can see

<!-- Page 261 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
the gas-lamps,
because then a link will be superfluous. Sally recognises the boy
more than ever.</p>

<p>"I wonder," she says, "if he's waiting outside. Because the party of
the house might allow him inside. Do you think I could ask, mother?"</p>

<p>"You might <i>try</i>, kitten," is the reply, not given sanguinely. And
Sally goes off, benevolent. "Even when your trousers are tied up
with string, a fog's a fog," says she to herself.</p>

<p>"I knoo our friend Lund first of all...." Thus the Major, nodding
towards the bedroom door.... "Why, God bless my soul, ma'am, I knew
Lund first of all, forty-six years ago in Delhi. Forty&mdash;six&mdash;years!
And all that time, if you believe me, he's been the same obstinate
moole. Never takin' a precaution about anythin', nor listening to a
word of advice!" This is about as far as he can go without a choke.
Rosalind goes into the next room to get a tumbler of water. The
nurse, who is sitting by the fire, nods towards the bed, and
Rosalind goes close to it to hear. "What is it, dear?" She speaks to
the invalid as to a little child.</p>

<p>"Isn't that Old Jack choking? I know his choke. What does he come
out for in weather like this? What does he mean? Send him back....
No, send him in here." The nurse puts in a headshake as protest. But
for all that, Sally finds, when she returns, that the two veterans
are contending together against their two enemies, bronchitis and
asthma, with the Intelligence Department sadly interrupted, and the
enemy in possession of all the advantageous points.</p>

<p>"He oughtn't to try to talk," says Rosalind. "But he will." She and
Sally and the nurse sit on in the fog-bound front room. The
gas-lights have no heart in them, and each wears a nimbus. Rosalind
wishes Gerry would return, aloud. Sally is buoyant about him; <i>he's</i>
all right, trust <i>him</i>! What about the everlasting young beggar?</p>

<p>"I persuaded Mrs.&nbsp;Kindred," says Sally. "And we looked outside for
him, and he'd gone."</p>

<p>"Fancy a woman being named Kindred!"</p>

<p>"When people are so genteel one can believe anything! But what do
you think the boy's name is?... Chancellorship! Isn't that queer?
She knows him&mdash;says he's always about in the

<!-- Page 262 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
neighbourhood. He
sleeps in the mews behind Great Toff House."</p>

<p>Her mother isn't listening. She rises for a moment to hear what she
may of how the talk in the next room goes on; and then, coming back,
says again she wishes Gerry was safe indoors, and Sally again says,
"Oh, <i>he's</i> all right!" The confidence these two have in one another
makes them a couple apart&mdash;a sort of league.</p>

<p>What Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick heard a scrap of in the next room would have been,
but for the alarums and excursions of the two enemies
aforementioned, a consecutive conversation as follows:</p>

<p>"You're gettin' round, Colonel?"</p>

<p>"A deal better, Major. I want to speak to <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Fire away, old Cockywax! You remember Hopkins?&mdash;Cartwright
Hopkins&mdash;man with a squint&mdash;at Mooltan&mdash;expression of his, 'Old
Cockywax.'"</p>

<p>"I remember him. Died of typhoid at Burrampore. Now you listen to
me, old chap, and don't talk&mdash;you only make yourself cough."</p>

<p>"It's only the dam fog. <i>I'm</i> all right."</p>

<p>"Well, shut up. That child in the next room&mdash;it's her I want to talk
about. You're the only man, as far as I know, that knows the story.
She doesn't. She's not to be told."</p>

<p>"Mum's the word, sir. Always say nothin', that's my motto.
Penderfield's daughter at Khopal&mdash;at least, he was her father. One
dam father's as good as another, as long as he goes to the devil."
This may be a kind of disclaimer of inheritance as a factor to be
reckoned with, an obscure suggestion that human parentage is without
influence on character. It is not well expressed.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Roper. You know the story. That's the only man I
can't say God forgive him to. God forgive <i>me</i>, but I can't."</p>

<p>"Devil take me if I can!... Yes, it's all right. They're all in the
next room...."</p>

<p>"But the woman was worse. She's living, you know...."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;shinin' light&mdash;purifying society&mdash;that's her game! I'd
purify <i>her</i>, if I had my way."</p>

<p>"Come a bit nearer&mdash;my voice goes. I've thought it all out. If the
girl, who supposes herself to be the daughter of her mother's

<!-- Page 263 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
husband, tries to run you into a corner&mdash;you understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you undeceive her. Her mother has never told her
<i>anything</i>. She doesn't suppose she had any hand in the divorce. She
thinks his name was Graythorpe, and doesn't know he wasn't her
father. Don't you undeceive her&mdash;promise."</p>

<p>But the speaker is so near the end of his tether that the Major has
barely time to say, "Honour bright, Colonel," when the bronchial
storm bursts. It may be that the last new anodyne, which is
warranted to have all the virtues and none of the ill-effects of
opium, had also come to the end of <i>its</i> tether. Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick came
quickly in, saying he had talked too much; and Sally, following her,
got Major Roper away, leaving the patient to her mother and the
nurse. The latter knew what it would be with all this talking&mdash;now
the temperature would go up, and he would have a bad night, and what
would Dr.&nbsp;Mildmay say?</p>

<p>Till the storm had subsided and a new dose of the sedative had been
given, Sally and Old Jack stood waiting in sympathetic pain&mdash;you
know what it is when you can do nothing. The latter derived some
insignificant comfort from suggestions through his own choking that
all this was due to neglect of his advice. When only moans and heavy
breathing were left, Sally went back into the bedroom. Her mother
was nursing the poor old racked head on her bosom, with the
sword-hand of the days gone by in her own. She said without speaking
that he would sleep presently, and the fewer in the room the better,
and Sally left them so, and went back.</p>

<p>Yes, the Major would take some toddy before he started for home. And
it was all ready, lemons and all, in the black polished wood
cellaret, with eagles' claws for feet. Sally got the ingredients out
and began to make it. But first she gently closed the door between
the rooms, to keep the sound of their voices in.</p>

<p>"You really did see my father, though, Major?" There seemed to be a
good deal of consideration before the answer came, not all to be
accounted for by asthma.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;certainly&mdash;oh yes. I saw Mr.&nbsp;Graythorpe once or twice. Another
spoonful&mdash;that's plenty." A pause.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 264 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Now, don't spill it. Take care, it's very hot. That's right."
Another pause. "Major Roper...."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear. What?"</p>

<p>"<i>Do</i> tell me what he was like."</p>

<p>"Have you never seen his portrait?"</p>

<p>"Mother burnt it while I was small. She told me. Do tell me what you
recollect him like."</p>

<p>"Fine handsome feller&mdash;well set up. Fine shot, too! Gad! that was a
neat thing! A bullet through a tiger two hundred yards off just
behind the ear."</p>

<p>"But I thought <i>his</i> name was Harrisson." The Major has got out of
his depth entirely through his own rashness. Why couldn't he leave
that tiger alone? Now he has to get into safe water again.</p>

<p>A good long choke is almost welcome at this moment. While it goes on
he can herald, by a chronic movement of a raised finger, his
readiness to explain all as soon as it stops. He catches at his
first articulation, so that not a moment may be lost. There were
<i>two</i> tigers&mdash;that's the explanation. Harrisson shot one, and
Graythorpe the other. The cross-examiner is dissatisfied.</p>

<p>"Which was the one that shot the tiger two hundred yards off, just
behind the ear?"</p>

<p>The old gentleman responds with a spirited decision: "Your father,
my dear, your father. That tiger round at my rooms&mdash;show it you if
you like&mdash;that skin was given me by a feller named Harrisson, in the
Commissariat&mdash;quite another sort of Johnny. He was down with the
Central Indian Horse&mdash;quite another place!" He dwells on the
inferiority of this shot, the smallness of the skin, the close
contiguity of its owner. A very inferior affair!</p>

<p>But, being desperately afraid of blundering again, he makes the fact
he admits, that he had confoozed between the two cases, a reason for
a close analysis of the merits of each. This has no interest for
Sally, who, indeed, had only regarded the conversation, so far, as a
stepping-stone she now wanted to leap to the mainland from. After
all, here she is face-to-face with a man who actually knows the
story of the separation, and can talk of it without pain. Why should
she not get something from him, however little? You see, the idea of
a something that could

<!-- Page 265 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
not be told was necessarily foreign to a
mind some somethings could not be told to. But she felt it would be
difficult to account to Major Roper for her own position. The fact
that she knew nothing proved that her mother and Colonel Lund had
been anxious she should know nothing. She could not refer to an
outsider over their heads. Still, she hoped, as Major Roper was
deemed on all hands an arrant old gossip, that he might accidentally
say something to enlighten her. She prolonged the conversation in
this hope.</p>

<p>"Was that before I was born?"</p>

<p>"The tiger-shootin'? Well, reely, my dear, I shouldn't like to say.
It's twenty years ago, you see. No, I couldn't say&mdash;couldn't say
when it was." He is beginning to pack himself in a long woollen
scarf an overcoat with fur facings will shortly cover in, and is, in
fact, preparing to evacuate a position he finds untenable. "I must
be thinkin' of gettin' home," he says. Sally tries for a word more.</p>

<p>"Was it before he and mother fell out?" It is on the Major's lips to
say, "Before the proceedings?" but he changes the expression.</p>

<p>"Before the split? Well, no; I should say after the split.
Yes&mdash;probably after the split." But an unfortunate garrulity prompts
him to say more. "After the split, I should say, and before
the&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;and then he feels he is in a quagmire, and flounders to
the nearest land&mdash;"before your father went away to Australia." Then
he discerns his own feebleness, recognising the platitude of this
last remark. For nobody could shoot tigers in an Indian jungle after
he had gone off to Australia. Clearly the sooner he gets away the
better.</p>

<p>A timely choking-fit interposes to preserve its victim from further
questioning. The patient in the next room is asleep or torpid, so he
omits farewells. Sally's mother comes out to say good-night, and
Sally goes down the staircase with him and his asthma, feeling that
it is horrible and barbarous to turn him out alone in the dense
blackness. Perhaps, however, the peculiar boy with the strange name
will be there. That would be better than nothing. Sally feels there
is something indomitable about that boy, and that fog nourishes and
stimulates it.</p>

<p>But, alas!&mdash;there is no boy. And yet it certainly would be
fourpence

<!-- Page 266 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
if he came back. For, though it may be possible to see the
street gas-lamps without getting inside the glass, you can't see
them from the pavement. Nevertheless, the faith that "it" is
clearing having been once founded, lives on itself in the face of
evidence, even as other faiths have done before now. So the creed is
briefly recited, and the Major disappears with the word good-night
still on his lips, and his cough, gasp, or choke dies away in the
fog as he vanishes.</p>

<p>Somebody is whistling "Arr-hyd-y-nos" as he comes from the other
side in the darkness&mdash;somebody who walks with a swinging step and a
resonant foot-beat, some one who cares nothing for fogs. Fenwick's
voice is defiant of it, exhilarated and exhilarating, as he ceases
to be a cloud and assumes an outline. Sally gives a kiss to frozen
hair that crackles.</p>

<p>"What's the kitten after, out in the cold? How's the Major?"</p>

<p>"Which? <i>Our</i> Major? He's a bit better, and the temperature's
lower." Sally believed this; a little thermometer thing was being
wielded as an implement of optimism, and had lent itself to
delusions.</p>

<p>"Oh, how scrunchy you are, your hands are all ice! Mamma's been
getting in a stew about <i>you</i>, squire." On which Fenwick, with the
slightest of whistles, passes Sally quickly and goes four steps at a
time up the stairs, still illuminated by Sally's gas-waste. For she
had left the lights at full cock all the way up.</p>

<p>"My dearest, you never got my telegram?" This is to Rosalind, who
has come out on the landing to meet him. But the failure of the
telegram&mdash;lost in the fog, no doubt&mdash;is a small matter. What shelves
it is the patient grief on the tired, handsome face Fenwick finds
tears on as he kisses it. Sally has the optimism all to herself now.
Her mother knows that her old friend and protector will not be here
long&mdash;that, of course, has been true some time. But there's the
suffering, present and to come.</p>

<p>"We needn't stop the chick hoping a little still if she likes." She
says it in a whisper. Sally is on the landing below; she hears the
whispering, and half guesses its meaning. Then she suppresses the
last gas-tap, and follows on into the front room, where the three
sit talking in undertones for perhaps an hour.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 267 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Yes, that monotonous sound is the breathing of the patient in the
next room, under the new narcotic which has none of the bad effects
of opium. The nurse is there watching him, and wondering whether it
will be a week, or twenty-four hours. She derives an impression from
something that the fog really is clearing at last, and goes to the
window to see. She is right, for at a window opposite are dimly
visible, from the candles on either side of the mirror, two white
arms that are "doing" the hair of a girl whose stays are much too
tight. She is dressing for late dinner or an early party. Then the
nurse, listening, understands that the traffic has been roused from
its long lethargy. "I thought I heard the wheels," she says to
herself. Then Sally also becomes aware of the sound in the traffic,
and goes to <i>her</i> window in the front room.</p>

<p>"You see I'm right," she says. "The people are letting their fires
out, and the fog's giving. Now I'm going to take you home,
Jeremiah." For the understanding is that these two shall return to
Krakatoa Villa, leaving Rosalind to watch with the nurse. She will
get a chop in half an hour's time. She can sleep on the sofa in the
front room if she feels inclined. All which is duty carried out or
arranged for.</p>

<p>After her supper Rosalind sat on by herself before the fire in the
front room. She did not want to be unsociable with the nurse; but
she wanted to think, alone. A weight was on her mind; the thought
that the dear old friend, who had been her father and refuge, should
never know that she again possessed her recovered husband on terms
almost as good as if that deadly passage in her early life had never
blasted the happiness of both. He would die, and it would have made
him so happy to know it. Was she right in keeping it back now? Had
she ever been right?</p>

<p>But if she told him now, the shock of the news might hasten his
collapse. Sudden news need not be bad to cause sudden death. And,
maybe the story would be too strange for him to grasp. Better be
silent. But oh! if he might have shared her happiness!</p>

<p>Drowsiness was upon her before she knew it. Better perhaps sleep a
little now, while he was sleeping. She looked in at him, and spoke
to the nurse. He lay there like a lifeless waxwork&mdash;blown through,
like an apparatus out of order, to simulate breath,

<!-- Page 268 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
and doing it
badly. How could he sleep when now and then it jerked him so? He
could, and she left him and lay down, and went suddenly to sleep.
After a time that was a journey through a desert, without landmarks,
she was as suddenly waked.</p>

<p>"What?... I thought you spoke...." And so some one had spoken, but
not to her. She started up, and went to where the nurse was
conversing through the open window with an inarticulate person in
the street below, behind the thick window-curtain she had kept
overlapped, to check the freezing air.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's a boy. I can't make out what he says."</p>

<p>"Let me come!" But Rosalind gets no nearer his meaning. She ends up
with, "I'll come down," and goes. The nurse closes the window and
goes back to the bedroom.</p>

<p>The street door opens easily, the Chubb lock being the only
fastening. The moment Rosalind sees the boy near she recognises him.
There is no doubt about the presumptuous expression, or the cause of
it. Also the ostentatious absence of the front tooth, clearly
accounting for inaudibility at a distance.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" asks Rosalind.</p>

<p>"Nothin' at all for myself. I come gratis, I did. There's a many
wouldn't." He is not too audible, even now; but he would be better
if he did not suck the cross-rail of the area paling.</p>

<p>"Why did you come?"</p>

<p>"To bring you the nooze. The old bloke's a friend of yours, missis.
Or p'r'aps he ain't! I can mizzle, you know, and no harm done."</p>

<p>"Oh no, don't mizzle on any account. Tell me about the old bloke. Do
you mean Major Roper?"</p>

<p>"Supposin' I do, why shouldn't I?" This singular boy seems to have
no way of communicating with his species except through defiances
and refutations. Rosalind accepts his question as an ordinary
assent, and does not make the mistake of entering into argument.</p>

<p>"Is he ill?" The boy nods. "Is he worse?" Another nod. "Has he gone
home to his club?" The boy evidently has a revelation to make, but
would consider it undignified to make it except as a denial of
something to the contrary. He sees his way after a brief
reflection.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 269 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"He ain't gone. He's been took."</p>

<p>"He's been taken? How has he been taken?"</p>

<p>"On a perambulance. Goin' easy! But he didn't say nothin'. Not harf
a word!"</p>

<p>"Had he fainted?" But this boy has another characteristic&mdash;when he
cannot understand he will not admit it. He keeps silence, and goes
on absorbing the railing. Rosalind asks further: "Was he dead?"</p>

<p>"It'd take a lawyer to tell that, missis."</p>

<p>"I can't stand here in the cold, my boy. Come in, and come up and
tell us." So he comes up, and Rosalind speaks to the nurse in the
other room, who comes; and then they turn seriously to getting the
boy's story.</p>

<p>He is all the easier for examination from the fact that he is
impressed, if not awed, by his surroundings. All the bounce is
knocked out of him, now that his foot is no longer on his native
heath, the street. Witness that the subject of his narrative, who
would certainly have been the old bloke where there was a paling to
suck, has become a simple pronoun, and no more!</p>

<p>"I see him afore, missis," he says. "That time wot I lighted him
round for twopence. And he says to come again in three-quarters of
an hour. And I says yes, I says. And he says not to be late. Nor yet
I shouldn't, only the water run so slow off the main, and I was
kep.... Yes, missis&mdash;a drorin' of it off in their own pails at the
balkny house by the mooze, where the supply is froze...."</p>

<p>"I see, you got a job to carry up pails of water from that thing
that sticks up in the road?"</p>

<p>"Yes, missis; by means of the turncock. Sim'lar I got wet. But I
didn't go to be late. It warn't much, in the manner of speakin'. I
was on his 'eels, clost."</p>

<p>"You caught him?"</p>

<p>"Heard him hoarckin' in the fog, and I says to my mate&mdash;boy by the
name of 'Ucklebridge, only chiefly called Slimy, to distinguish
him&mdash;I says&mdash;I says that was my guv'nor, safe and square, by the
token of the sound of it. And then I catches him up in the fog,
follerin' by the sound. My word, missis, he <i>was</i> bad! Wanted to
holler me over the coals, he did, for behind my

<!-- Page 270 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
time. I could hear
him wantin' to do it. But he couldn't come by the breath."</p>

<p>Poor Old Jack! The two women look at each other, and then say to the
boy: "Go on."</p>

<p>"Holdin' by the palins, he was, and goin' slow. Then he choked it
off like, and got a chanst for a word, and he says: 'Now, you young
see-saw'&mdash;that's what he said, missis, 'see-saw'&mdash;'just you stir
your stumps and cut along to the clubbus: and tell that dam
red-faced fool Mulberry to look sharp and send one of the young
fellers to lend an arm, and not to come hisself.' And then he got
out a little flat bottle of something short, and went for a nip; but
the cough took him, and it sprouted over his wropper and was
wasted."</p>

<p>The women look at each other again. The nurse sees well into the
story, and says quickly under her breath to Rosalind: "He'd been
told what to do if he felt it coming. A drop of brandy might have
made the difference." The boy goes on as soon as he is waited for.</p>

<p>"Mr.&nbsp;Mulberry he comes runnin' hisself, and a couple more on 'em!
And then they all calls me a young varmint by reason of the guv'nor
having got lost. But a gentleman what comes up, he says all go
opposite ways, he says, and you'll hear him in the fog. So I runs up
a parsage, and in the middle of the parsage I tumbles over the
guv'nor lyin' acrost the parsage. Then I hollers, and then they
come."</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" says Rosalind; for this boy had that terrible power of
vivid description which flinches at no realism&mdash;<i>seems</i> to enjoy the
horror of it; does not really. Probably it was only his intense
anxiety to communicate <i>all</i>, struggling with his sense of his lack
of language&mdash;a privilege enjoyed by guv'nors. But Rosalind feels the
earnestness of his brief epic. He winds it up:</p>

<p>"But the guv'nor, he'd done hoarckin'. Nor he never spoke. The
gentleman I told you, he says leave him lyin' a minute, he says, and
he runs. Then back he comes with the apoarthecary&mdash;him with the red
light&mdash;and they rips the guv'nor's sleeves up, spilin' his coat. And
they prokes into his arm with a packin'-needle. Much use it done!
And then they says, it warn't the fog, and I called 'em a liar. 'Cos
it's a clearin' off, they says. It warn't, not much. I see the
perambulance come, and they shoved

<!-- Page 271 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
him in, and I hooked it off, and
heard 'em saying where's that young shaver, they says; he'll be
wanted for his testament. So I hooked it off."</p>

<p>"And where did you go?"</p>

<p>"To a wisit on a friend, I did. Me and Slimy&mdash;him I mentioned afore.
And he says, he says, to come on here&mdash;on'y later. So then I come on
here."</p>

<p>Rosalind finds herself, in the face of what she feels must mean Old
Jack's sudden death, thinking how sorry she is she can command no
pair of trousers of a reasonable size to replace this boy's drenched
ones&mdash;a pair that would need no string. A crude brew of hot toddy,
and most of the cake that had appealed to Major Roper in vain, and
never gone back to the cellaret, were the only consolations
possible. They seemed welcome, but under protest.</p>

<p>"Shan't I carry of 'em outside, missis?"</p>

<p>"On the stairs, then." This assent is really because both women
believe he will be comfortabler there than in the room. "Where are
you going to sleep?" Rosalind asks, as he takes the cake and tumbler
away to the stairs. She puts a gas-jet on half-cock.</p>

<p>"Twopenny doss in Spur Street, off of 'Orseferry Road, Westminster."
This identification is to help Rosalind, as she may not be able to
spot this particular doss-house among all she knows.</p>

<p>"Do you always sleep there?"</p>

<p>"No, missis! Weather permitting, in our mooze&mdash;on the 'eap. The
'orse-keeper gives a sack in return for a bit of cleanin', early,
before comin' away."</p>

<p>"What are you?" says Rosalind. She is thinking aloud more than
asking a question. But the boy answers:</p>

<p>"I'm a wife, I am. Never learned no tride, ye see!... Oh yes; I've
been to school&mdash;board-school scollard. But they don't learn you no
tride. You parses your standards and chucks 'em." This incredible
boy, who deliberately called himself a waif (that was his meaning),
was it possible that he had passed through a board-school? Well,
perhaps he was the highest type of competitive examinee, who can
learn everything and forget everything.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 272 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"But you have a father?"</p>

<p>"I could show him you. But he don't hold with teachin' his sons
trides, by reason of their gettin' some of his wiges. He's in the
sanitary engineering himself, but he don't do no work." Rosalind
looks puzzled. "That's his tride&mdash;sanitary engineering, lavatries,
plumbin', and fittin'. Been out of work better than three years. He
can jint you off puppies' tails, though, at a shillin'. But he don't
only get a light job now and again, 'cos the tride ain't wot it was.
They've been shearin' of 'em off of late years. Thank you, missis."
The refreshments have vanished as by magic, and Rosalind gives the
boy the rest of the cake and a coin, and he goes away presumably to
the doss-house he smells so strong of, having been warmed, that a
flavour of the heap in the mews would have been welcome in exchange.
So Rosalind thinks as she opens the window a moment and looks out.
She can quite see the houses opposite. The fog has cleared till the
morning.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is the relenting of the atmospheric conditions, or
perhaps it is the oxygen that the patient has been inhaling off and
on, that has slightly revived him. Or perhaps it is the champagne
that comes up through a tap in the cork, and reminds Rosalind's
ill-slept brain of something heard very lately&mdash;what on earth
exactly was it? Oh, she knows! Of course, the thing in the street
the sanitary engineer's son drew the pails of water at for the house
with the balcony. It is pleasanter to know; might have fidgeted her
if she had not found out. But she is badly in want of sleep, that's
the truth!</p>

<p>"I thought Major Roper was gone, Rosey." He can talk through his
heavy breathing. It must be the purer air.</p>

<p>"So he is, dear. He went two hours ago." She sits by him, taking his
hand as before. The nurse is, by arrangement, to take her spell of
sleep now.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's my head. I thought he was here just now&mdash;just this
minute."</p>

<p>"No, dear; you've mixed him up with Gerry, when he came in to say
good-night. Major Roper went away first. It wasn't seven o'clock."
But there is something excited and puzzled in the patient's voice as
he answers&mdash;something that makes her feel creepy.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 273 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Are you <i>sure</i>? I mean, when he came back into the room with his
coat on."</p>

<p>"You are dreaming, dear! He never came back. He went straight away."</p>

<p>"Dreaming! Not a bit of it. You weren't here." He is so positive
that Rosalind thinks best to humour him.</p>

<p>"I suppose I was speaking to Mrs.&nbsp;Kindred. What did he come back to
say, dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing! At least, I had told him not to chatter to Sallykin
about the old story, and he came back, I suppose, to say he
wouldn't." He seemed to think the incident, as an incident, closed;
but presently goes on talking about things that arise from it.</p>

<p>"Old Jack's the only one of them all that knew anything about
it&mdash;that Sallykin is likely to come across. Pellew knew, of course;
but he's not an old chatterbox like Roper."</p>

<p>Ought not Rosalind to tell the news that has just reached her? She
asks herself the question, and answers it: "Not till he rallies,
certainly. If he does not rally, why then&mdash;&mdash;!" Why then he either
will know or won't want to.</p>

<p>She has far less desire to tell him this than she has to talk of the
identity of her husband. She would almost be glad, as he is to
die&mdash;her old friend&mdash;that she should have some certainty beforehand
of the exact time of his death, so that she might, only for an hour,
have a companion in her secrecy. If only he and she might have borne
the burden of it together! She reproached herself, now that it was
too late, with her mistrust of his powers of retaining a secret. See
how keenly alive he was to the need of keeping Sally's parentage in
the dark! And <i>that</i> was what the whole thing turned on. Gerry's
continued ignorance might be desirable, but was a mere flea-bite by
comparison. In her strained, sleepless, overwrought state the wish
that "the Major" should know of her happiness while they could still
speak of it together grew from a passing thought of how nice it
might have been, that could not be, to a dumb dominant longing that
it should be. Still, after all, the only fear was that he should
talk to Gerry; and how easy to keep Gerry out of the room! And
suppose he did talk! Would Gerry believe him? There was risky ground
there, though.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 274 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
</div>

<p>She was not sorry when no more speech came through the heavy
breathing of the invalid. He had talked a good deal, and a
semi-stupor followed, relieving her from the strong temptation she
had felt to lead him back to their past memories, and feel for some
means of putting him in possession of the truth. As the tension of
her mind grew less, she became aware this would have been no easy
thing to do. Then, as she sat holding the old hand, and wondering
that anything so frail could still keep in bond a spirit weary of
its prison, drowsiness crept over her once more, all the sooner for
the monotonous rhythm of the heavy breath. Consciousness gave place
to a state of mysterious discomfort, complicated with intersecting
strings and a grave sense of responsibility, and then to oblivion.
After a few thousand years, probably minutes on the clock, a jerk
woke her.</p>

<p>"Oh dear! I was asleep."</p>

<p>"You might give me another nip of the champagne, Rosey dear. And
then you must go and lie down. I shall be all right. Is it late?"</p>

<p>"Not very. About twelve. I'll look at my watch." She does so, and it
is past one. Then the invalid, being raised up towards his
champagne, has a sudden attack of coughing, which brings in the
nurse as a reserve. Presently he is reinstated in semi-comfort, half
a tone weaker, but with something to say. And so little voice to say
it with! Rosalind puts her ear close, and repeats what she catches.</p>

<p>"Why did Major Roper come back? He didn't, dear. He went away about
seven, and has not been here since."</p>

<p>"He was in the room just this minute." The voice is barely audible,
the conviction of the speaker absolute. He is wandering. The nurse's
mind decides, in an innermost recess, that it won't be very long
now.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Rosalind looked out through a spot she had rubbed clean on the
frozen window-pane, and saw that it was bright starlight. The fog
had gone. That boy&mdash;he was asleep at the twopenny doss, and the
trousers were drying. What a good thing that he should be totally
insensitive to atmosphere, as no doubt he was.</p>

<p>The hardest hours for the watcher by a sick-bed are those that

<!-- Page 275 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
cannot be convinced that they belong to the previous day. One
o'clock may be coaxed or bribed easily enough into winking at a
pretence that it is only a corollary of twelve; two o'clock protests
against it audibly, and every quarter-chime endorses its claim to be
to-morrow; three o'clock makes short work of an imposture only a
depraved effrontery can endeavour to foist upon it. Rosalind was
aware of her unfitness to sit up all night&mdash;all this next night&mdash;but
nursed the pretext that it had not come, and that it was still
to-day, until a sense of the morning chill, and something in the way
the sound of each belated cab confessed to its own scarcity,
convinced her of the uselessness of further effort. Then she
surrendered the point, short of the stroke of three, and exchanged
posts with the nurse, who promised to call her at once should it
seem necessary to do so. Sleep came with a rush, and dreamless
oblivion. Then, immediately, the hand of the nurse on her shoulder,
and her voice, a sudden shock in the absolute stillness:</p>

<p>"I thought it better to wake you, Mrs.&nbsp;Nightingale. I am <i>so</i>
sorry...."</p>

<p>"Oh dear! how long have I slept?" Rosalind's mind leaped through a
second of unconsciousness of where she is and what it's all about to
a state of intense wakefulness. "What o'clock is it?"</p>

<p>"It's half-past six. I should have left you to have your sleep out,
only he wanted you.... Yes, he woke up and asked for you, and then
asked again. He's hardly coughed."</p>

<p>"I'll come." Rosalind tried for alacrity, but found she was quite
stiff. The fire was only a remnant of red glow that collapsed feebly
as the nurse touched it with the poker. It was a case for a couple
of little gluey wheels, and a good contribution to the day's fog,
already in course of formation, with every grate in London panting
to take shares. Rosalind did not wait to see the black column of
smoke start for its chimney-pot, but went straight to the patient's
bedside.</p>

<p>"Is that Rosey? I can't see very well. Come and sit beside me. I
want you." He was speaking more easily than before, so his hearer
thought. Could it be a change for the better? She put her finger on
the pulse, but it was hard to find. The fever had left him for the
time being, but its work was done. It was

<!-- Page 276 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
wonderful, though, that
he should have so much life in him for speech.</p>

<p>"What is it, Major dear?... Let's get the pillow right.... There,
that's better! Yes, dear; what is it?"</p>

<p>"I've got my marching orders, Rosey. I shall be all right. Shan't be
sorry ... when it's over.... Rosey girl, I want you to do something
for me.... Is my watch there, with the keys?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; the two little keys."</p>

<p>"The little one opens my desk ... with the brass corners.... Yes,
that one.... Open the top flap, and look in the little left-hand
drawer. Got it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you want the letters out? There's only one packet."</p>

<p>"That's the lot. Read what's written on them."</p>

<p>"Only 'Emily, 1837.'"</p>

<p>"Quite right! That was your aunt, you know&mdash;your father's sister.
Don't cry, darling. Nothing to cry about! I'm only an old chap.
There, there!" Rosalind sat down again by the bed, keeping the
packet of letters in her hand. Presently the old man, who had closed
his eyes as though dozing, opened them and said: "Have you put them
on the fire?"</p>

<p>"No. Was I to?"</p>

<p>"That was what I meant. I thought I said so.... Yes; pop 'em on."
Rosalind went to the fireside and stood hesitating, till the old man
repeated his last words; then threw the love-letters of sixty years
ago in a good hot place in the burning coal. A flare, and they were
white ash trying to escape from a valley of burning rocks; then even
that was free to rise. Maybe the only one who ever read them would
be soon&mdash;would be a mere attenuated ash, at least, as far as what
lay on that bed went, so pale and evanescent even now.</p>

<p>"A fool of a boy, Rosey dear," said the old voice, as she took her
place by the bed again. "Just a fool of a boy, to keep them all
those years. And <i>she</i> married to another fellow, and a
great-grandmother. Ah, well!... don't you cry about it, Rosey....
All done now!" She may have heard him wrong, for his voice went to a
whisper. She wondered at the way the cough was sparing him.</p>

<p>Then she thought he was falling asleep again; but presently he

<!-- Page 277 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
spoke. "I shall do very well now.... Nothing but a little rest ...
that's all I want now. Only there's something I wanted to say about
... about...."</p>

<p>"About Sally?" Rosalind guessed quickly, and certainly.</p>

<p>"Ah ... about the baby. <i>Your</i> baby, Rosey.... That man that was her
father ... he's on my mind...."</p>

<p>"Oh me, forget him, dear&mdash;forget him! Leave him to God!" Rosalind
repeated a phrase used twenty years ago by herself in answer to the
old soldier's first uncontrollable outburst of anger against the man
who had made her his victim. His voice rose again above a whisper as
he answered:</p>

<p>"I heard you say so, dear child ... then ... that time. You were
right, and I was wrong. But what I've said&mdash;many a time, God forgive
me!&mdash;that I prayed he was in hell. I would be glad now to think I
had not said it."</p>

<p>"Don't think of it. Oh, my dear, don't think of it! You never meant
it...."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I did, though; and would again, mind you, Rosey! Only&mdash;not
now! Better let him go, for Sallykin's sake.... The child's the
puzzle of it...."</p>

<p>Rosalind thought she saw what he was trying to say, and herself
tried to supplement it. "You mean, why isn't Sally like him?"</p>

<p>"Ah, to be sure! Like father like son, they say. His son's a chip of
the old block. But then&mdash;he's his mother's son, too. Two such!&mdash;and
then see what comes of 'em. Sallykin's your daughter ... Rosey's
daughter. Sallykin...." He seemed to be drowsing off from mere
weakness; but he had something to say, and his mind made for speech
and found it:</p>

<p>"Yes, Rosey; it's the end of the story. Soon off&mdash;I shall be! Not
very long now. Wasn't it foggy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; it was. But it's clear now. It's snowing."</p>

<p>"Then you could send for Jack Roper. Old Jack! He can tell me
something I want to know.... I know he can...."</p>

<p>"But it's the middle of the night, dear. We can't send for him now.
Sally shall go for him again when she comes in the morning. What is
it you want to know?"</p>

<p>"What became of poor Algernon Palliser.... I know Old Jack

<!-- Page 278 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
knows.... Something he heard.... I forget things ... my head's not
good. Ah, Rosey darling! if I'd been there in the first of it ... I
could have got speech of him. I might have ... might have...."</p>

<p>As the old man's mind wandered back to the terrible time it dragged
his hearer's with it. Rosalind tried to bear it by thinking of what
Sally was like in those days, crumpled, violent, vociferous,
altogether <i>intransigeante</i>. But it was only a moment's salve to a
reeling of the reason she knew must come if this went on. If he
slept it might be averted. She thought he was dropping off, but he
roused himself again to say: "What became of poor Palliser&mdash;your
husband?"</p>

<p>Then Rosalind, whose head was swimming, let the fact slip from her
that the dying man had never seen or known her husband in the old
days; only he had always spoken of him as one to be pitied, not
blamed, even as she herself thought of him. Incautiously she now
said, "Poor Gerry!" forgetting that Colonel Lund had never known him
by that name, or so slightly that it did not connect itself. Yet his
mind was marvellously clear, too; for he immediately replied: "I did
not mean Fenwick. I meant your first husband. Poor boy! poor fellow!
What became of him?"</p>

<p>"<i>His</i> name was Algernon, too," was all the answer she could think
of. It was a sort of forlorn hope in nettle-grasping. Then she saw
it had little meaning in it for her listener. His voice went on,
almost whispering:</p>

<p>"Many a time I've thought ... if we could have found the poor boy
... and shown him Sally ... he might have ... might have...."</p>

<p>Rosalind could bear it no longer. Whoever reads this story
carelessly may see little excuse for her that she should lose her
head at the bedside of a dying man. It was really no matter for
surprise that she should do so. Consider the perpetual tension of
her life, the broken insufficient sleep of the last two days, the
shock of "Old Jack's" sudden death a few hours since! Small blame to
her, to our thinking, if she did give way! To some it may even seem,
as to us, that the course she took was best in the end. And, indeed,
her self-control stood by her to the last; it was a retreat in
perfect order, not a flight. Nor did she,

<!-- Page 279 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
perhaps, fully measure
how near her old friend was to his end, or release&mdash;a better name,
perhaps.</p>

<p>"Major dear, I have something I must tell you." The old eyelids
opened, and his eyes turned to her, though he remained
motionless&mdash;quite as one who caught the appeal in the tension of her
voice and guessed its meaning.</p>

<p>"Rosey darling&mdash;yes; tell me now." His voice tried to rise above a
whisper; an effort seemed to be in it to say: "Don't keep anything
back on my account."</p>

<p>"So I will, dear. Shut your eyes and lie quiet and listen. I want to
tell you that I know that my first husband is not dead.... Yes,
dear; don't try to speak. You'll see when I tell you.... Algernon
Palliser is not dead, though we thought he must be. He went away
from Lahore after the proceedings, and he did go to Australia, no
doubt, as we heard at the time; but after that he went to America,
and was there till two years ago ... and then he came to England."
The old man tried to speak, but this time his voice failed, and
Rosalind thought it best to go straight on. "He came to England,
dear, and met with a bad accident, and lost his memory...."</p>

<p>"<i>What!</i>" The word came so suddenly and clearly that it gave her new
courage to go on. She <i>must</i> tell it all now, and she felt sure he
was hearing and understanding all she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; it's all true. Let me tell it all. He lost his memory
completely, so that he did not know his own name...."</p>

<p>"My God!"</p>

<p>"Did not know his own name, dear&mdash;did not know his own name&mdash;did not
know the face of the wife he lost twenty years ago&mdash;all, all a
blank!... Yes, yes; it was he himself, and I took him and kept him,
and I have him now ... and oh, my dear, my dear, he does not know
it&mdash;knows <i>nothing</i>! He does not know who I am, nor who he was, nor
that Sally is the baby; but he loves her dearly, as he never could
have loved her if ... if...."</p>

<p>She could say no more. The torrent of tears that was the first
actual relief to the weight upon her heart of two years of secrecy
grew and grew till speech was overwhelmed. But she knew that her
story, however scantily told, had reached her listener's

<!-- Page 280 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
mind,
though she could not have said precisely at what moment he came to
know it. The tone of his exclamation, "My God!" perhaps had made her
take his knowledge for granted. Of one thing, however, she felt
certain&mdash;that details were needless, would add nothing to the main
fact, which she was quite convinced her old friend had grasped with
a mind still capable of holding it, although it might be in death.
Even so one tells a child the outcome only of what one tells in full
to older ears. Then quick on the heels of the relief of sharing her
burden with another followed the thought of how soon the sympathy
she had gained must be lost, buried&mdash;so runs the code of current
speech&mdash;in her old friend's grave. All her heart poured out in tears
on the hand that could still close fitfully upon her own as she
knelt by the bed on which he would so soon lie dying.</p>

<p>Presently his voice came again&mdash;a faint whisper she could just
catch: "Tell it me again, Rosey ... what you told me just now ...
just now." And she felt his cold hand close on hers as he spoke.
Then she repeated what she had said before, adding only: "But he may
never come to know his own story, and Sally must not know it." The
old whisper came back, and she caught the words: "Then it is true!
My God!"</p>

<p>She remained kneeling motionless beside him. His breath, weak and
intermittent, but seeming more free than when she left him four
hours since, was less audible than the heavy sleep of the overtaxed
nurse in the next room, heard through the unclosed door. The
familiar early noises of the street, the life outside that cares so
little for the death within, the daily bread and daily milk that
wake us too soon in the morning, the cynical interchanges of
cheerful early risers about the comfort of the weather&mdash;all grew and
gathered towards the coming day. But the old Colonel heard none of
them. What thought he still had could say to him that this was good
and that was good, hard though it might be to hold it in mind. But
one bright golden thread ran clear through all the tangled
skeins&mdash;he would leave Rosey happy at last, for all the bitterness
her cup of life had held before.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>The nurse had slept profoundly, but she was one of those fortunate
people who can do so at will, and then wake up at an appointed

<!-- Page 281 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
time, as many great soldiers have been able to do. As the clock
struck eight she sat up in the chair she had been sleeping in and
listened a moment. No sound came from the next room. She rose and
pushed the door open cautiously and looked in. Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick was
still kneeling by the bed, her face hidden, still holding the old
man's hand. The nurse thought surely the still white face she saw in
the intermittent gleams of a lamp-flame flickering out was the face
of a dead man. Need she rouse or disturb the watcher by his side?
Not yet, certainly. She pulled the door very gently back, not
closing it.</p>

<p>A sound came of footsteps on the stairs&mdash;footsteps without voices.
It was Fenwick and Sally, who had passed through the street door,
open for a negotiation for removal of the snow&mdash;for the last two
hours had made a white world outside. Sally was on a stairflight in
the rear. She had paused for a word with the boy Chancellorship, who
was a candidate for snow-removal. He seemed relieved by the snow. It
was a tidy lot better morning than last night, missis. He had
breakfasted&mdash;yes&mdash;off of corfy, and paid for it, and buttered 'arf
slices and no stintin', for twopence. Sally had a fellow-feeling for
this boy's optimism. But he had something on his mind, for when
Sally asked him if Major Roper had got home safe last night, his
cheerfulness clouded over, and he said first, "Couldn't say,
missis;" and then, "He's been got home, you may place your
dependence on that;" adding, inexplicably to Sally, "He won't care
about this weather; it won't be no odds!" She couldn't wait to find
out his meaning, but told him he might go on clearing away the snow,
and when Mrs.&nbsp;Kindred came he was to say Miss Rosalind Nightingale
told him he might. She said she would be answerable, and then ran to
catch up Fenwick.</p>

<p>The nurse came out to meet them on the landing, and in answer to
Fenwick's half-inquiry or look of inquiry&mdash;Sally did not gather
which&mdash;said: "Yes&mdash;at least, I think so&mdash;just now." Sally made up
her mind it was death. But it was not, quite; for as the nurse,
preceding them, pushed the door of the sickroom gently open, the
voice of the man she believed dead came out almost strong and clear
in the silence: "Evil has turned to good. God be praised!"</p>

<div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
</div>

<p>But they were the last words Colonel Lund spoke. He died so quietly
that the exact moment of dissolution was not distinguishable.
Fenwick and Sally found Rosalind so overstrained with grief and
watching that they asked for no explanation of the words. Indeed,
they may not have ascribed any special meaning to them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p class="subhead">ABOUT SIX MONTHS, AND HOW A CABMAN SAW A GHOST. OF SALLY'S AND THE
DOCTOR'S "MODUS VIVENDI," AND THE SHOOSMITH FAMILY. HOW SALLY MADE
TEA FOR BUDDHA, AND HOW BUDDHA FORESAW A STEPDAUGHTER. DELIRIUM
TREMENS</p>

<p>It may make this story easier to read at this point if we tell our
reader that this twenty-fifth chapter contains little of vital
import&mdash;is, in fact, only a passing reference to one or two
by-incidents that came about in the half-year that followed. He
cannot complain that they are superfluous if we give him fair
warning of their triviality, and enable him to skip them without
remorse. But they register, to our thinking, what little progress
events made in six very nice months&mdash;a period Time may be said to
have skipped. And whoso will may follow his example, and lose but
little in the doing of it.</p>

<p>Very nice months they were&mdash;only one cloud worth mention in the
blue; only one phrase in a minor key. The old familiar figure of
"the Major"&mdash;intermittent, certainly, but none the less invariable;
making the house his own, or letting it appropriate him, hard to say
which&mdash;was no longer to be seen; but the old sword had been hung in
a place of honour near a portrait of Paul Nightingale, Mrs.
Fenwick's stepfather&mdash;its old owner's school-friend of seventy years
ago. At her death it was to be offered to the school; no surviving
relative was named in the will, if any existed. Everything was left
unconditionally "to my dear daughter by adoption, Rosalind
Nightingale."</p>

<p>Some redistributions of furniture were involved in the importation
of the movables from the two rooms in Ball Street. The black
cabinet, or cellaret, with the eagle-talons, found a place in the
dining-room in the basement into which Fenwick&mdash;only it seems so odd
to go back to it now&mdash;was brought on the afternoon of his
electrocution. Sally always thought of this cabinet as "Major
Roper's cabinet," because she got the whiskey from it for him

<!-- Page 284 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
before he went off in the fog. If only she had made him drunk that
evening! Who knows but it might have enabled him to fight against
that terrible heart-failure that was not the result of atmospheric
conditions. She never looked at this cabinet but the thought passed
through her mind.</p>

<p>Her mother certainly told her nothing at this time about her last
conversation with the Colonel, or almost nothing. Certainly she
mentioned more than once what she thought a curious
circumstance&mdash;that the invalid, who was utterly ignorant of Old
Jack's death, had persisted so strongly that he was present in the
room when he must have been dead some hours. Every one of us has his
little bit of Psychical Research, which he demands respect for from
others, whose own cherished private instances he dismisses without
investigation. This example became Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick's; who, to be just,
had not set herself up with one previously, in spite of the
temptation the Anglo-Indian is always under to espouse Mahatmas and
buried Faquirs and the like. There seemed a good prospect that it
would become an article of faith with her; her first verdict&mdash;that
it was an hallucination&mdash;having been undermined by a certain
contradictiousness, produced in her by an undeserved discredit
poured on it by pretenders to a superior ghost-insight; who, after
all, tried to utilise it afterward as a peg to hang their own
particular ghosts on. Which wasn't researching fair.</p>

<p>Sally was no better than the rest of them; if anything, she was a
little worse. And Rosalind was far from sure that her husband
wouldn't have been much more reasonable if he hadn't had Sally there
to encourage him. As it was, the league became, <i>pro hac vice</i>, a
league of Incredulity, a syndicate of Materialists. Rosalind got no
quarter for the half-belief she had in what the old Colonel had said
on his death-bed. Her report of his evident earnestness and the
self-possession of his voice carried no weight; failing powers,
delirium, effects of opiates, and ten degrees above normal had it
all their own way. Besides, her superstition was weak-kneed. It only
went the length of suggesting that it really was very curious when
you came to think of it, and she couldn't make it out.</p>

<p>That the incident received such very superficial recognition must be
accounted for by the fact that Krakatoa Villa was not a

<!-- Page 285 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
villa of
the speculative-thinker class. We have known such villas elsewhere,
but we are bound to say we have known none where speculative thought
has tackled the troublesome questions of death-bed appearances,
haunted houses, <i>et id genus omne</i>, with the result of coming to any
but very speculative conclusions. The male head of this household
may have felt that he himself, as a problem for the Psychical
Researcher, was ill-fitted to discuss the subject. He certainly
shied off expressing any decided opinions.</p>

<p>"What do you really think about ghosts?" said his wife to him one
day, when Sally wasn't there to come in with her chaff.</p>

<p>"Ghosts belong in titled families. Middle-class ghosts are a poor
lot. Those in the army and navy cut the best figure, on the
whole&mdash;Junior United Service ghosts...."</p>

<p>"Gerry, be serious, or I'll have a divorce!" This was a powerful
grip on a stinging-nettle. Rosalind felt braced by the effort. "Did
you ever see a ghost, old man?"</p>

<p>"Not in the present era, sweetheart. I can't say about B.C." He used
to speak of his life in this way, but his wife always felt sorry
when he alluded to it. It seldom happened. "No, I have never seen
one to my knowledge. I've been seen as a ghost, though, which is
very unpleasant, I assure you."</p>

<p>Rosalind's mind went back to the fat Baron at Sonnenberg. She
supposed this to be another case of the same sort. "When was that?"
she said.</p>

<p>"Monday. I took a hansom from Cornhill to our bonded warehouse. It's
under a mile, and I asked the driver to change half-a-crown; I
hadn't a shilling. He got out a handful of silver, and when he had
picked out the two shillings and sixpence he looked at me for the
first time, and started and stared as if I was a ghost in good
earnest."</p>

<p>"Oh, Gerry, he must have seen you before&mdash;before it happened!"
Remember that this was, in the spirit of it, a fib, seeing that the
tone of voice was that of welcome to a possible revelation. To our
thinking, the more honour to her who spoke it, considering the
motives. Gerry continued:</p>

<p>"So I thought at first. But listen to what followed. As soon as his
surprise, whatever caused it, had toned down to mere recognition
point, he spoke with equanimity. 'I've driven you afore

<!-- Page 286 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
now,
mister,' said he. 'You won't call me to mind. Parties don't, not
when fares; when drivers, quite otherwise. I'm by way of taking
notice myself. You'll excuse <i>me</i>?' Then he said, 'War-r-r-p,' to
the horse, who was trying to eat himself and dig the road up. When
they were friends again, I asked, Where had he seen me? Might I
happen to call to mind Livermore's Rents, and that turn-up?&mdash;that
was his reply. I said I mightn't; or didn't, at any rate. I had
never been near Livermore's Rents, nor any one else's rents, that I
could recall the name of. 'Try again, guv'nor,' said he. 'You'll
recall if you try hard enough. <i>He</i> recollects it, <i>I'll</i> go bail.
My Goard! you <i>did</i> let him have it!' Was it a fight? I asked. Well,
do you know, darling, that cabby addressed me seriously; took me to
task for want of candour. 'That ain't worthy of a guv'nor like you,'
he said. 'Why make any concealments? Why not treat me open?' I gave
him my most solemn honour that I was utterly at a loss to guess what
he was talking about, on which he put me through a sort of
retrospective catechism, broken by reminders to the horse. '<i>You</i>
don't rec'lect goin' easy over the bridge for to see the shipping?
Nor yet the little narrer court right-hand side of the road, with an
iron post under an arch and parties hollerin' murder at the far end?
Nor yet the way you held him in hand and played him? Nor yet what
you sampled him out at the finish? My Goard!' He slapped the top of
the cab in a sort of ecstasy. 'Never saw a neater thing in my life.
<i>No</i> unnecessary violence, <i>no</i> agitation! And him carried off the
ground as good as dead! Ah! I made inquiry after, and that was
<i>so</i>.' I then said it must have been some one else very like me, and
held out my half-crown. He slipped back his change into his own
pocket, and when he had buttoned it over ostentatiously addressed me
again with what seemed a last appeal. 'I take it, guv'nor,' said he,
'you may have such a powerful list of fighting fixtures in the week
that you don't easy recollect one out from the other. But <i>now</i>,
<i>do</i>, <i>you</i>, <i>mean</i> to say your memory don't serve you in this?&mdash;I
drove you over to Bishopsgate, 'cross London Bridge. Very well! Then
you bought a hat&mdash;white Panama&mdash;and took change, seein' your own was
lost. And you was going to pay me, and I drove off, refusin' to
accept a farden under the circumstances. Don't you rec'lect that?' I
said I didn't.

<!-- Page 287 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
'Well, I <i>did</i>,' said he. 'And, with your leave,
I'll do the same thing now. I'll drive you most anywhere you'd like
to name in reason, but I won't take a farden.' And, do you know, he
was off before my surprise allowed me to say a word."</p>

<p>"Now, Gerry, was it that made you so glum on Monday when you came
back? I recollect quite well. So would Sally."</p>

<p>"Oh no; it was uncomfortable at first, but I soon forgot all about
it. I recollect what it was put me in the dumps quite well. It was a
long time after the cabby."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was as I walked to the station. I went a little way round,
and passed through an anonymous sort of a churchyard. I saw a box in
a wall with 'Contributions' on it, and remembering that I really had
no right to the cabby's shilling or eighteenpence, I dropped a
florin in. And then, Rosey dear, I had the most horrible recurrence
I've had for a long time&mdash;something about the same place and the
same box, and some one else putting three shillings in it. And it
was all mixed up with a bottle of champagne and a bank. I can't
explain why these things are so painful, but they are. <i>You</i> know,
Rosey!"</p>

<p>"I know, dear." His wife's knowledge seemed to make her quite silent
and absent. She may have seen that the recovery of this cabman would
supply a clue to her husband's story. Had he taken the number of the
cab? No, he hadn't. Very stupid of him! But he had no pencil, or he
could have written it on his shirt-sleeve. He couldn't trust his
memory. Rosalind didn't feel very sorry the clue was lost. As for
him, did he, we wonder, really exert himself to remember the cab's
number?</p>

<p>But when the story was told afterwards to Sally, the moment the
Panama hat came on the tapis, she struck in with, "Jeremiah! you
know quite well you had a Panama hat on the day you were
electrocuted. And, what's more, it was brand new! And, what's more,
it's outside in the hall!"</p>

<p>It was brought in, and produced a spurious sense of being detectives
on the way to a discovery. But nothing came of it.</p>

<p>All through the discussion of this odd cab-incident the fact that
Fenwick "would have written down the cab-driver's number on his
shirt-sleeve," was on the watch for a recollection by one of the
three that a something had been found written on the shirt-cuff

<!-- Page 288 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Fenwick was electrocuted in. The ill-starred shrewdness of Scotland
Yard, by detecting a mere date in that something, had quite thrown
it out of gear as an item of evidence. By the way, did no one ever
ask why should any man, being of sound mind, write the current date
on his shirt-sleeve? It really is a thing that can look after its
own interests for twenty-four hours. The fact is that, no sooner do
coincidences come into court, than sane investigation flies out at
the skylight.</p>

<p>There was much discussion of this incident, you may be sure; but
that is all we need to know about it.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Our other chance gleanings of the half-year are in quite another
part of the field. They relate to Sally and Dr.&nbsp;Vereker's relation
to one another. If this relation had anything lover-like in it, they
certainly were not taking Europe into their confidence on the
subject. Whether their attitude was a spontaneous expression of
respectful indifference, or a <i>parti-pris</i> to mislead and hoodwink
her, of course Europe couldn't tell. All that that continent, or the
subdivision of it known as Shepherd's Bush, could see was a parade
of callousness and studied civility on the part of both. The only
circumstance that impaired its integrity or made the bystander doubt
the good faith of its performers was the fact that one of them was a
girl, and an attractive one&mdash;so attractive that elderly ladies
jumped meanly at the supposed privileges of their age and sex, and
kissed her a great deal more than was at all fair or honourable.</p>

<p>The ostentatious exclusion of Cupid from the relationship of these
two demanded a certain mechanism. Every meeting had to be accounted
for, or there was no knowing what match-making busybodies wouldn't
say; or, rather, what they would say would be easily guessable by
the lowest human insight. Not that either of them ever mentioned
precaution to the other; all its advantages would have vanished with
open acknowledgment of its necessity. These arrangements were
instinctive on the part of both, and each credited the other with a
mole-like blindness to their existence.</p>

<p>For instance, each was graciously pleased to believe&mdash;or, at least,
to believe that the other believed&mdash;in a certain institution that
called for a vast amount of checking of totals, comparisons of
counterfoils, inspection of certificates, verification of
data&mdash;everything,

<!-- Page 289 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
in short, of which an institute is capable that
could make incessant correspondence necessary and frequent personal
interviews advisable. It could boast of Heaven knows how many titled
Patrons and Patronesses, Committees and Sub-committees, Referees and
Auditors. No doubt the mere mention of such an institution was
enough to render gossip speechless about any single lady and
gentleman whom it accidentally made known one to another. Its firm
of Solicitors alone, with a line all to itself in its prospectuses,
was enough to put a host of Loves to flight.</p>

<p>On which account Ann, at Krakatoa Villa, when she announced, "A
person for you, Miss Sally," was able to add, "from Dr.&nbsp;Vereker, I
think, miss," without the faintest shade of humorous reserve, as of
one who sees, and does not need to be told.</p>

<p>And when Sally had interviewed a hopeless and lopsided female, who
appeared to be precariously held together by pins, and to have an
almost superhuman power of evading practical issues, she (fortified
by this institution) was able to return to the drawing-room and say,
without a particle of shame, that she supposed she should have to go
and see Old Prosy about Mrs.&nbsp;Shoosmith to-morrow afternoon. And when
she called at the doctor's at teatime&mdash;because that didn't take him
from his patients, as he made a point of his tea, because of his
mother, if it was only ten minutes&mdash;both he and she believed
religiously in Mrs.&nbsp;Shoosmith, and Dr.&nbsp;Vereker filled out her form
(we believe we have the phrase right) with the most business-like
gravity at the little table where he wrote his letters.</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Shoosmith's form called for filling out in more senses than
one. The doctor's mother's form would not have borne anything
further in that direction; except, indeed, she had been provided
with hooks to go over her chair back, and keep her from rolling
along the floor, as a sphere might if asked to sit down.</p>

<p>A suggestion of the exceptional character of all visits from Sally
to Dr.&nbsp;Vereker, and <i>vice-versa</i>, was fostered by the domestics at
his house as well as at Krakatoa Villa. The maid Craddock, who
responded to Sally's knock on this Shoosmith occasion, threw doubt
on the possibility of the doctor ever being visible again, and kept
the door mentally on the jar while she spoke through a moral gap an
inch wide. Of course, that is only our nonsense. Sally was really in
the house when Craddock heroically,

<!-- Page 290 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
as a forlorn hope in a lost
cause, offered to "go and see"; and going, said, "Miss Nightingale;
and is Dr.&nbsp;Vereker expected in to tea?" without varnish of style, or
redundance of wording. But Sally lent herself to this insincere
performance, and remained in the hall until she was called on to
decide whether she would mind coming in and waiting, and Dr.&nbsp;Vereker
would perhaps be back in a few minutes. All this was part of the
system of insincerity we have hinted at.</p>

<p>So was the tenor of Sally's remarks, while she waited the few
minutes, to the effect that it was a burning shame that she should
take up Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker's time, a crying scandal that she should
interrupt her knitting, and a matter of penitential reflection that
she hadn't written instead of coming, which would have done just as
well. To which Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker, with a certain parade of pretended
insincerity (to make the real article underneath seem <i>bona fides</i>),
replied with mock-incredible statements about the pleasure she
always had in seeing Sally, and the rare good fortune which had
prompted a visit at this time, when, in addition to being unable to
knit, owing to her eyes, she had been absorbed in longing for news
of a current event that Sally was sure to know about. She
particularised it.</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't <i>true</i>, Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker! You don't mean to say you
believed <i>that</i> nonsense? The idea! Tishy&mdash;just fancy!" Goody
Vereker (the name Sally thought of her by) couldn't shake her head,
the fulness at the neck forbade it; but she moved it cosily from
side to side continuously, much as a practicable image of Buddha
might have done.</p>

<p>"My child, I've quite given up believing and disbelieving things. I
wait to be told, and then I ask if it's true. Now you've told me. It
isn't true, and that settles the matter."</p>

<p>"But whoever could tell you such <i>nonsense</i>, Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker?"</p>

<p>"A little bird, my dear." The image of Buddha left off the movement
of incredulity, and began a very gentle, slow nod. "A little bird
tells me these things&mdash;all sorts of things. But now I <i>know</i> this
one's untrue I should never <i>dream</i> of believing it. Not for one
moment."</p>

<p>Sally felt inclined to pinch, bite, or otherwise maltreat the
speaker, so very worthless did her offer of optional disbelief seem,
and, indeed, so very offensive. But her inclination only went the

<!-- Page 291 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
length of wondering how she could get at a vulnerable point through
so much fat.</p>

<p>"Tishy quarrels with her mother, I <i>know</i>," said she. "But as to her
doing anything like <i>that</i>! Besides, she never told me. Besides, I
should have been asked to the wedding. Besides," etcetera.</p>

<p>For, you see, what this elderly lady had asked the truth about was,
had or had not L&aelig;titia Wilson and Julius Bradshaw been privately
married six months ago? Probably, during &aelig;ons and epochs of
knitting, she had dreamed that some one had told her this. Or, even
more probably, she had invented it on the spot, to see what change
she could get out of Sally. She knew that Sally, prudently
exasperated, would give tongue; whereas conciliatory, cosy
inquisition&mdash;the right way to approach the elderly gossip&mdash;would
only make her reticent. Now it was only necessary to knit, and Sally
would be sure to develop the subject. The line she appeared to take
was that it was a horrible shame of people to say such things, in
view of the fact that it was only yesterday that Tishy had quite
settled that rash matrimony in defiance of her parents would not
only be inexcusable but wrong. Sally laid a fiery emphasis on the
only-ness of yesterday, and seemed to imply that, had it been a week
ago, there would have been much more plausibility in the story of
this secret nuptial of six months back.</p>

<p>"Besides," she went on, accumulating items of refutation, "Julius
has only his salary, and Tishy has nothing&mdash;though, of course, she
could teach. Besides, Julius has his mother and sister, and they
have only a hundred and fifty a year. It does as long as they all
live together. But it wouldn't do if Julius married." On which the
old Goody (Sally told her mother after) embarked on a long analysis
of how joint housekeeping could be managed if Tishy would consent to
be absorbed into the Bradshaw household. She made rather a grievance
of it that Sally could not supply data of the sleeping accommodation
at Georgiana Terrace, Bayswater. If she had known that, she could
have got them all billeted on different rooms. As it was, she had to
be content to enlarge on the many economies the family could achieve
if they consented to be guided by a person of experience&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
herself.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 292 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Of course, dinner would have to be late," she said, "because of Mr.
Bradshaw not getting home till nearly eight. They would have to make
it supper. And it might be cold; it's a great saving, and makes it
so easy where there's one servant." Sally shuddered with horror at
this implied British household. Poor Tishy!</p>

<p>"But they're <i>not going</i> to marry till they see their way," she
exclaimed in despair. She felt that Tishy and Julius were being
involved, entangled, immeshed by an old matrimonial octopus in
gilt-rimmed spectacles&mdash;like Professor Wilson's&mdash;who could knit
tranquilly all the while, while she herself could do nothing to save
them. "It might be cold!!" Every evening, perhaps&mdash;who knows?</p>

<p>"Very proper, my dear." Thus the Octopus. "I felt sure such a nice,
sensible girl as Miss Wilson never would. That is Conrad." It really
was a sound of a latch-key, but speech is no mere slave to fact.</p>

<p>"And I was really quite glad when Dr.&nbsp;Prosy came in&mdash;the way the
Goody was going on about Tishy!" So Sally said to her mother when
she had completed her report of the portion of this visit she chose
to tell about. On which her mother said, "What a dear little humbug
you are, kitten," and she replied, as we have heard her reply
before, "We-e-ell, there's nothing in that!" and posed as one who
has been misrepresented. But her mother stuck to her point, which
was that Sally knew she was quite glad when Dr.&nbsp;Vereker came in,
Tishy or no.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason was that Sally was quite glad at the appearance
of Dr.&nbsp;Prosy, there could be no doubt about the fact. Her laugh
reached the cook in the kitchen, who denounced Craddock the
parlourmaid for not telling her it was Miss Nightingale, when it
might have been a visitor, seeing no noise come of it. Cook remarked
she knew how it would be&mdash;there was the doctor picking up like&mdash;and
hadn't she told Craddock so? But Craddock said no!</p>

<p>"Mrs.&nbsp;Shoosmith again&mdash;the everlasting Mrs.&nbsp;Shoosmith!" exclaimed
the doctor. It was very unfeeling of them to laugh so over this
unhappy woman, who was the survivor of two husbands and the
proprietor of one, and the mother of seven daughters and five sons,
each of whom was a typical "case," and all

<!-- Page 293 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
of whom sought admission
to Institutes on their merits. The lives of the whole family were
passed in applications for testimonials and certificates, alike
bearing witness to their chronic qualifications for it. Sally was
mysteriously hardhearted about them, while fully admitting their
claims on the public.</p>

<p>"That's right, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad"&mdash;Sally had inaugurated this name for
herself&mdash;"Honoria Purvis Shoosmith. Mind you put in the Purvis
right. Now write down lots of diseases for her to have." Sally is
leaning over the doctor's chair to see him write as she says this.
There is something in the atmosphere of the situation that seems to
clash with the actual business in hand. The doctor endeavours, not
seriously enough, perhaps, to infuse a flavour of responsibility.</p>

<p>"My professional dignity, Miss Nightingale, will not permit of the
scheme of diagnosis you indicate. If any disorders entirely without
symptoms were known to exist, I should be delighted to ascribe the
whole of them to Mrs.&nbsp;Shoosmith...."</p>

<p>"Don't be prosy, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad. Fire away! You told me lots&mdash;you know
you did! Rheumatic arthritis&mdash;gout&mdash;py&aelig;mia...."</p>

<p>"Come, I say, Miss Sally, draw it mild. I never said py&aelig;mia.
<i>An</i>&aelig;mia, perhaps...."</p>

<p>"Very well, Anne, then! We can let it go at that. Fire away!" The
doctor looks round his own corner at the rows of pearls and the
laugh that frames them, the merry eyebrows and the scintillating
eyes they accentuate. A perilous intoxication, not to be too freely
indulged in by a serious professional man at any time&mdash;in business
hours certainly not. But if the doctor were quite in earnest over a
sort of Spartan declaration of policy his heart feels the prudence
of, would that responsive twinkle flutter in his face behind its
mock gravity? He is all but head over ears in love with Sally&mdash;so
why pretend? Really, we don't know&mdash;and that's the truth.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be a good way to consider what it is that is really the
matter, and make out the statement accordingly?" He goes on looking
at Sally, scratches himself under the chin with his pen, and waits
for an answer.</p>

<p>"Good, sensible, general practitioner! See how practical he is! Now,
I should never have thought of that!"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 294 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Well, what shall we put her down as? Chronic arthritis&mdash;spinal
curvature&mdash;tuberculosis of the cervical vertebr&aelig;?"</p>

<p>"Those all sound very nice. But I don't think it matters which you
choose. If she hasn't got it now, she'll develop it if I describe
it. When I told her mother couldn't get rid of her neuritis, she
immediately asked to know the symptoms, and forthwith claimed them
as her own. 'Well, there now, and to think what I was just a-sayin'
to Shoosmith, this very morning! Just in the crick of the
thumb-joint, you can't 'ardly abear yourself!' And then she told how
she said to Shoosmith frequent, where was the use of his getting
impatient, and exclaimin' the worst expressions? Because his
language went beyond a quart, and no reasonable excuse."</p>

<p>"Mr.&nbsp;Shoosmith doesn't seem a very promising sort? He's a tailor,
isn't he?"</p>

<p>"No; he's a messenger. He runs on errands and does odd jobs. But he
can't run&mdash;I've seen him!&mdash;he can only shamble. And his voice is
hoarse and inaudible. And he has a drawback&mdash;two drawbacks, in fact.
He is no sooner giv' coppers on a job than he drinks them."</p>

<p>"What's the other?"</p>

<p>"His susceptibility to intoxicants. His 'ed is that weak that 'most
anythink upsets him. So you see."</p>

<p>"Poor chap! He's handicapped in the race of life. As for his wife,
when I saw her she was suffering with acute rheumatism and bad
feeling&mdash;and, I may add, defective reasoning power. However...." The
doctor fills in blanks, adds a signature, says "There we are!" and
Mrs.&nbsp;Shoosmith is disposed of as an applicant to the institution,
and will no doubt reap some benefits we need not know the
particulars of. But she remains as a subject for the student of
human life&mdash;also, tea comes&mdash;also, which is interesting, Sally
proceeds to make it.</p>

<p>Now, if the reserves this young lady had made about this visit, if
her pretence that it was a necessity arising from a charitable
organization, if the colour that was given to that pretence by her
interview with the servant Craddock&mdash;if any of these things had been
more or less than the grossest hypocrisy, would it, we ask you, have
been accepted as a matter of course that she should pull off her
gloves and sit down to make tea with a mature knowledge

<!-- Page 295 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
of how to
get the little lynch-pin out of the spirit-lamp, and of how many
spoonfuls? No; the fact is, Sally was a more frequent visitor to the
image of Buddha than she chose to admit; and as for the doctor, he
seized every legitimate opportunity of 'cello practice at Krakatoa
Villa. But G.P.'s cannot call their time their own.</p>

<p>"The funny part of Mrs.&nbsp;Shoosmith," said Sally, when the pot was
full up and the lid shut, "is that the moment she is brought into
contact with warm soapy water and scrubbing-brushes, she seems to
renew her youth. She brings large pins out of her mouth and secures
her apron. And then she scrubs. Now you may blow the methylated out
and make yourself useful, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad."</p>

<p>"Does she put back the pins when she's done scrubbing?" the doctor
asks, when he has made himself useful.</p>

<p>"She puts them back against another time, so I have understood. I
suppose they live in her mouth. That's yours with two lumps. That is
your mother's&mdash;no, I won't pour it yet. She's asleep."</p>

<p>For the fact is that the Goody, anxious to invest herself with an
appearance of forbearance towards the frivolities of youth,
readiness to forego (from amiability) any share in the conversation,
insight into the <i>rapports</i> of others (especially male and female
<i>rapports</i>), and general superiority to human weakness, had
endeavoured to express all these things by laying down her knitting,
folding her hands on her circumference, and looking as if she knew
and could speak if she chose. But if you do this, even the
maintenance of an attentive hypodermic smile is not enough to keep
you awake&mdash;and off you go! The Goody did, and the smile died slowly
off into a snore. Never mind! She was in want of rest, so she said.
It was curious, too, for she seldom got anything else.</p>

<p>It would have been unfeeling to wake her, so Dr.&nbsp;Vereker went and
sat a good deal nearer Sally, not to make more noise than was
necessary. This reacted, an outsider might have inferred, on the
subject-matter of the conversation, making it more serious in tone.
And as Sally put the little Turk's cap over the pot to keep it warm,
and the doctor knew perfectly well that the blacker the tea was the
better his mother liked it, this lasted until that lady

<!-- Page 296 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
woke up
with a start a long time after, and said she must have been asleep.
Then, as Cook was aware in the kitchen, some more noise came of it,
and Sally carried off Mrs.&nbsp;Shoosmith's certificate.</p>

<p>"You know, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad, it makes you look like a real medical man,"
she said at the gate, referring to the detention of the doctor's
pill-box, which awaited him, and he replied that it didn't matter.
King, the driver, looked as if he thought it <i>did</i>, and appeared
morose. Is it because coachmen always keep their appointments with
society and society never keeps its appointments with coachmen that
a settled melancholy seems to brood over them, and their souls seem
cankered with misanthropy?</p>

<p>The doctor had rather a rough time that evening. For among the
patients he was going to try to see and get back to dinner (thus ran
current speech of those concerned) there was a young man from the
West Indies, who had come into something considerable. But he was
afflicted with a disorder he called the "jumps," and the doctor's
diagnosis, if correct, showed that the <i>vera causa</i> of this
aptly-named disease was alcohol of sp. gr. something, to which the
patient was in the habit of adding very few atoms of water indeed.
The doctor was doing all he could to change the regimen, but only
succeeded on making his patient weak and promise amendment. On this
particular evening the latter quite unexpectedly went for the
doctor's throat, shouting, "I see your plans!" and King had to be
summoned from his box to help restrain him. So Dr.&nbsp;Vereker was tired
when he got home late to dinner, and would have felt miserable, only
he could always shut his eyes and think of Sally's hands that had
come over his shoulder to discriminate points in Mrs.&nbsp;Shoosmith's
magna-charta. They had come so near him that he could smell the
fresh sweet dressing of the new kid gloves&mdash;six and a half, we
believe.</p>

<p>But although he liked his Goody mother to talk to him about the girl
who had christened her so, he was tired enough this evening to wish
that her talk had flowed in a less pebbly channel. For she chose
this opportunity to enlarge upon the duties of young married women
towards their husbands' parents, their mothers especially. Her
conclusion was a little unexpected:</p>

<p>"I have said nothing throughout, my dear. I should not dream of

<!-- Page 297 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
doing so. But if I had I trust I should have made it clearly
understood how I regarded Miss L&aelig;titia Wilson's conduct."</p>

<p>"But there wasn't any. Nobody contracted a private marriage."</p>

<p>"My dear Conrad! Have I said that any one has done so? Have I used
the expression 'private marriage'?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;no. I don't think you have. Not to-day, at least."</p>

<p>"When have I done so? Have I not, on the contrary, from the very
beginning told you I should take the first opportunity of
disbelieving so absurd and mischievous a story? And have I lost a
moment? Was it not the first word I said to Sally Nightingale before
you came in, and without a soul in the room to hear? I only ask for
justice. But if my son misrepresents me, what can I expect from
others?" At this point patient toleration only.</p>

<p>"But, mother dear, I don't <i>want</i> to misrepresent you. Only I'll be
hanged if I see why Tishy Wilson is to be hauled over the coals?"</p>

<p>A suggestion of a proper spirit showed itself. "I am accustomed to
your language, and will say nothing. But, my dear Conrad, for you
are always my son, and will remain so, whatever your language may
be, do you, my dear Conrad, do you really sanction the attitude of a
young lady who refuses to marry&mdash;public and private don't come into
the matter&mdash;because of a groundless antipathy? For it is admitted on
all hands that Mrs.&nbsp;Julius Bradshaw is a person of rather superior
class."</p>

<p>"She's Mrs.&nbsp;Bradshaw&mdash;not Mrs.&nbsp;Julius. But what makes you suppose
Tishy Wilson objects to her?"</p>

<p>"My dear Conrad, you know as well as I do that is a mere
prevarication. Why evade the point? But in my opinion you do wisely
not to attempt any defence of L&aelig;titia Wilson. It may be true that
she has not laid herself open to misconstruction in this case, but
the lack of good feeling is to all intents and purposes the same as
if she had; and I must say, my dear Conrad, I am surprised that a
professional man with your qualifications should undertake to
justify her."</p>

<p>"But Miss Wilson hasn't <i>done</i> anything! What are you wigging away
at her for, mother dear?"</p>

<p>"Have I not expressly said that she has done nothing whatever? Of

<!-- Page 298 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
course she has not, and, I hope, never will. But it is easy for you,
Conrad, to take refuge in a fact which I have been scrupulously
careful to admit from the very beginning. And 'wigging away!' What
language!"</p>

<p>"Never mind the language, mother darling! Tell me what it's all
about." Tired as he is, he gets up from the chair he has not been
smoking in (because this is the drawing-room) to go round and kiss
what is probably the fatty integument of a very selfish old woman,
but which he believes to be that of an affectionate mother. "What's
it all about?" he repeats.</p>

<p>"My dear Conrad! Is it not a little unfeeling to ask me what it is
all about when you know?"</p>

<p>"I <i>don't</i> know, mother dear. I can do any amount of guessing, but I
don't <i>know</i>."</p>

<p>"I think, my dear, if you will light my candle and ring for Craddock
to shut up, that I had better go to bed." Which her son does, but
perversely abstains from giving the old lady any assistance to
saying what is in her mind to say.</p>

<p>But she did not intend to be baffled. For when he had piloted her to
her state apartment, carrying her candle, under injunctions on no
account to spill the grease, and a magazine of wraps and wools and
unintelligible sundries, she contrived to invest an elucidation of
her ideas with an appearance of benevolence by working in a
readiness to sacrifice herself to her son's selfish longing for
tobacco.</p>

<p>"Only just hear me to the end, my dear, and then you can get away to
your pipe. What I did <i>not</i> say&mdash;for you interrupted me&mdash;did not
relate so much to Miss L&aelig;titia Wilson as to Sally Nightingale. She,
I am sure, would never come between any man she married and his
mother. I am making no reference to any one whatever, although,
however old I am, I have eyes in my head and can see. But I can read
character, and that is my interpretation of Sally Nightingale's."</p>

<p>"Sally Nightingale and I are not going to make it up, if that's what
you mean, mother. She wouldn't have me, for one thing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear, I am not going to argue the point. It is nearly eleven,
and unless I get to bed I shan't sleep. Now go away to your pipe,
and think of what I have said. And don't slam your door

<!-- Page 299 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
and wake me
when you come up." She offered him a selection to kiss, shutting her
eyes tight. And he gave place to Craddock, and went away to his
unwholesome, smelly habit, as his mamma had more than once called
it. His face was perplexed and uncomfortable; however, it got ease
after a few puffs of pale returns and a welcome minute of memory of
the bouquet of those sixes.</p>

<p>But his little happy oasis was a very small one. For a messenger
came with a furious pull at the night-bell and a summons for the
doctor. His delirium-tremens case had very nearly qualified its
brain for a P.M.&mdash;at least, if there were any of it left&mdash;by getting
at a pistol and taking a bad aim at it. The unhappy dipsomaniac was
half-shot, and prompt medical attendance was necessary to prevent
the something considerable being claimed by his heir-at-law.</p>

<p>Whether this came to pass or not does not concern us. This much is
certain, that at the end of six months which this chapter
represents, and which you have probably skipped, he was as much
forgotten by the doctor as the pipe his patient's suicidal escapade
had interrupted, or the semi-vexation with his mother he was using
it as an anodyne for.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p class="subhead">MORNING AT LADBROKE GROVE ROAD, AND FAMILY DISSENSION. FACCIOLATI,
AND A LEGACY. THE LAST CONCERT THIS SEASON. THE GOODY WILL COME TO
IGGULDEN'S. BUT FANCY PROSY IN&nbsp;LOVE!</p>

<p>Towards the end of the July that very quickly followed Rosalind
noticed an intensification of what might be called the Ladbroke
Grove Road Row Chronicle&mdash;a record transmitted by Sally to her real
and adopted parent in the instalments in which she received it from
Tishy.</p>

<p>This record on one occasion depicted a battle-royal at breakfast,
"over the marmalade," Sally said. She added that the Dragon might
just as well have let the Professor alone. "He was reading," she
said, "'The Classification of Roots in Prehistoric Dialects,'
because I saw the back; and Tacitus was on the butter. But the
Dragon likes the grease to spoil the bindings, and she knows it."</p>

<p>A vision of priceless Groliers soaking passed through Rosalind's
mind. "Wasn't that what this row was about, then?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Sally, who had gone home to breakfast with
Tishy after an early swim. "It's difficult to say what it was about.
Really, the Professor had hardly said <i>anything at all</i>, and the
Dragon said she thought he was forgetting the servants. Fossett
wasn't even in the room. And then the Dragon said, 'Yes, shut it,'
to Athene. Fancy saying 'Yes, shut it,' in a confidential semitone!
Really, I can't see that it was so very wrong of Egerton, although
he <i>is</i> a booby, to say there was no fun in having a row before
breakfast. He didn't mean them to think he meant them to hear."</p>

<p>"But how did it get from the marmalade to Tishy's haberdasher?"
asked Fenwick.</p>

<p>"Can't say, Jeremiah. It all came in a buzz, like a wopses nest. And
then Egerton said it was rows, rows, rows all day long,

<!-- Page 301 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
and he
should hook it off and get a situation. It <i>is</i> rows, rows, rows, so
it's no use pretending it isn't. But it always comes round to the
haberdasher grievance in the end. This time Tishy went to her father
in the library, and confessed up about Kensington Gardens."</p>

<p>Both hearers said, "Oh, I see!" and then Sally transmitted the
report of this interview. It had not been stormy, and may be looked
at by the light of the Professor's last remark. "The upshot is,
Tish, that you can marry Julius against your mother's consent right
off, and never lose a penny of your aunt's legacy."</p>

<p>"Legacy is good, very excellent good," said Fenwick. "How much was
it, Sarah?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. Lots&mdash;a good lot&mdash;a thousand pounds! The Dragon
wanted to make out that it was conditional on her consent to Tishy's
marriage. That was fibs. But what I don't see is that Gaffer Wilson
ever said a word to Tishy about his own objections to her marrying
Julius, if he has any!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Rosalind suggested, "she hasn't told you all he said."
But to this Sally replied that Tishy had told her over and over and
over again, only she said <i>over</i> so often that her adopted parent
said for Heaven's sake stop, or he should write the word into his
letters. However, the end of the last despatch was at hand, and he
himself took up the conversation on signing it.</p>

<p>"Yours faithfully, Algernon Fenwick. That's the lot! I agree with
the kitten."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"About if he has any. I believe he'd be glad if Miss Wilson took the
bit in her teeth and bolted."</p>

<p>"You agree with Prosy?" As Sally says this, without a thought in a
thoughtful face but what belongs to the subject, her mother is
conscious that she herself is quite prepared to infer that Prosy
already knows all about it. She has got into the habit of hearing
that he knows about things.</p>

<p>"What does Vereker say?" Thus Fenwick.</p>

<p>"He'll be here in a minute, and you can ask him. That's him! I mean
that's his ring."</p>

<p>"It's just like any other ring, chick." It is her mother who speaks.
But Sally says: "Nonsense! as if I didn't know Prosy's ring!"

<!-- Page 302 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
And
Dr.&nbsp;Vereker appears, quartet bound, for this was the weekly musical
evening at Krakatoa Villa.</p>

<p>"Jeremiah wants to know whether you don't think Tishy's male parent
would be jolly glad if she and Julius took the bit in their teeth
and bolted?" "I shouldn't be the least surprised if they did," is
the doctor's reply. But it does not strike Sally as rising to the
height of her Draconic summary.</p>

<p>"You're not shining, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad," she says; "you're evading the
point. What do <i>you</i> think Gaffer Bristles thinks, that's the
point?" Dr.&nbsp;Conrad appears greatly exhilarated and refreshed by
Sally, whose mother seems to share his feeling, but she enjoins
caution, for all that.</p>

<p>"Do take care, kitten," she says. "They're on the stairs." But Sally
considers "they" are miles off, and will take ages getting upstairs.
"They've only just met at the door," is her explanatory comment,
showing appreciation of one human weakness.</p>

<p>"Suppose we were to get it put in more official form!" Fenwick
suggests. "Would Professor Sales Wilson be very much shocked if his
daughter and Paganini made a runaway match of it?" The name Paganini
has somehow leaked out of Cattley's counting-house, and become
common property.</p>

<p>"I think, if you ask me," says Vereker, speaking to Fenwick, but
never taking his eyes off Sally, on whom they feed, "that Professor
Sales Wilson would be very much relieved."</p>

<p>"<i>That's</i> right!" says Sally, speaking as to a pupil who has
profited. "Now you're being a good little General Practitioner." And
then, the ages having elapsed with some alacrity, the door opens and
the two subjects of discussion make their appearance.</p>

<p>The anomalous cousin did not come with them, having subsided. Mrs.
Fenwick herself had taken the pianoforte parts lately. She had
always been a fair pianist, and application had made her passable&mdash;a
good make-shift, anyhow. So you may fill out the programme to your
liking&mdash;it really doesn't matter what they played&mdash;and consider that
this musical evening was one of their best that season. It was just
as well it should be so, as it was their last till the autumn. Sally
and her mother were going to the seaside all August and some of
September, and Fenwick was coming with them for a week at first, and
after that for short week-end

<!-- Page 303 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
spells. He had become a partner in
the wine-business, and was not so much tied to the desk.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>"Well, then, it's good-bye, I suppose?" The speaker is Rosalind
herself, as the Stradivarius is being put to bed. But she hasn't the
heart to let the verdict stand&mdash;at least, as far as the doctor is
concerned. She softens it, adds a recommendation to mercy. "Unless
you'll come down and pay us a visit. We'll put you up somewhere."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it isn't possible," is the answer. But the doctor can't
get his eyes really off Sally. Even as a small boy might strain at
the leash to get back to a source of cake against the grasp of an
iron nurse, even so Dr.&nbsp;Conrad rebels against the grip of
professional engagements, which is the name of his cold, remorseless
tyrant. But Sally is harnessing up a coach-and-six to drive through
human obligations. Her manner of addressing the doctor suggests
previous talk on the subject.</p>

<p>"You <i>must</i> get the locum, and come. You know you can, and it's all
nonsense about can't." What would be effrontery in another character
makes Sally speak through and across the company. A secret
confidence between herself and the doctor, that you are welcome to
the full knowledge of, and be hanged to you! is what the manner of
the two implies.</p>

<p>"I spoke to Neckitt about it, and he can't manage it," says the
doctor in the same manner. But the first and second violin are
waiting to take leave.</p>

<p>"We'll say good-night, then&mdash;or good-bye, if it's for six weeks."
Tishy is perfectly unblushing about the <i>we</i>. She might be conveying
Mr.&nbsp;Tishy away. They go, and get away from Dr.&nbsp;Vereker, by-the-bye.
An awkward third isn't wanted.</p>

<p>"There's plenty more Neckitts where he comes from," pursues Sally,
as the "other two"&mdash;for that is how Fenwick thinks of them&mdash;get
themselves and their instruments out of the house. "So don't be
nonsensical, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad.... Stop a moment. I <i>must</i> speak to Tishy."
And Sally gives chase, and overtakes the other two just by the
fire-alarm, where Fenwick came to a standstill. Do you remember? It
certainly has been a record effort to "get away first." You know
this experience yourself at parties? Sally speaks to Tishy in the
glorious summer night, and

<!-- Page 304 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
the three talk together earnestly under
innumerable constellations, and one gas-lamp that elbows the starry
heavens out of the way&mdash;a self-asserting, cheeky gas-lamp.</p>

<p>The doctor organizes tactics rapidly. He can hear that Sally's step
goes up the street, and then the voices at a distance. If he can say
good-bye and rush away just as Sally does the same, why then they
will meet outside, don't you see?</p>

<p>Rosalind and her husband seem to have wireless telegrams passing.
For when Sally vanishes there is a ring as of instruction received
in the tone of Fenwick's voice as he addresses the doctor:</p>

<p>"Couldn't you manage to get your mother to come too, Vereker? She
must be terribly in want of a change."</p>

<p>"So I tell her; but she's so difficult to move."</p>

<p>"Have a sedan-chair thing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't mean that&mdash;not physically difficult. I mean she's got so
anchored no one can persuade her to move. She hasn't been away for
ages."</p>

<p>"Sally must go and persuade her." It is Rosalind who says this. "I'm
sure Sally will manage it."</p>

<p>"She will if any one can," says the doctor. "Of course, I could soon
get a locum if there was a chance of mother." And then the
conversation supports itself on the possible impossibility of
finding a lodging at St.&nbsp;Sennans-on-Sea, and consoles itself with
its intense improbability till the doctor finds it necessary to
depart with the promptitude of a fire-engine suddenly rung up.</p>

<p>He had calculated his time to a nicety, for he met Sally just as
"the other two" got safe round the corner.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>"Oh no," said Fenwick, replying to a query; "he doesn't mean to
carry it all the way. He'll pick up a cab at the corner." The query
was about the violoncello, and Fenwick was coming back to the room
where his wife was closing the piano in anticipation of Ann. He had
discreetly launched the instrument and its owner under the stars,
and left the street door standing wide open&mdash;a shallow pretence that
he believed Sally already in touch with it.</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> a funny couple," Rosalind said. "Just fancy! They've
known each other two years, and there they are! But I

<!-- Page 305 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
do like him.
It's all his mother, you know ... what is?... why, goose&mdash;of course
I mean he would speak at once if it wasn't for that obese mother of
his."</p>

<p>"But she's so fond of Sally." In reply to this his wife kisses his
cheeks, forehead, and chin consecutively, and he says it was right
that time, only the other way round. This refers to a system founded
on the crossing incident at Rheims.</p>

<p>"Of course she is, darling; or pretends she is. But he can neither
divorce his mamma nor ask the kitten to marry her. You see?"</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;in fact, I've thought so myself. In confidence, you know.
But is no compromise possible?" Rosalind shakes a slow, regretful,
negative head, and her lips form a silent "No!"</p>

<p>"Not with her. The woman has her own share of selfishness, and her
son's, too. <i>He</i> has none."</p>

<p>"But Sally."</p>

<p>"I see what you mean. Sally goes to the wall one way if she doesn't
the other. So he works out selfish, poor dear fellow! in the end.
But, Gerry darling, let me tell you this: you have no idea how
impossible that young man thinks it that a girl should love <i>him</i>.
If he thought it possible the kitten really cared about, or could
care about him, he'd go clean off his head. Indeed, I am right."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are. There she is."</p>

<p>Sally ran straight upstairs, leaving Ann to close the door. She at
once discharged her mind of its burden, <i>more suo</i>.</p>

<p>"Prosy thinks so, too!"</p>

<p>"Thinks what?"</p>

<p>"Thinks they'll go and get married one fine morning, whether or no!"</p>

<p>But she seemed to be the only one much excited about this. Something
was preoccupying the other two minds, and our Sally had not the
remotest notion what.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Nevertheless, it came about that before the next Monday&mdash;the day of
Sally's departure with her mother to St.&nbsp;Sennans-on-Sea&mdash;that young
person paid a farewell visit to the obese mother of her medical
adviser, and found her knitting.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 306 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"That, my dear, is what I am constantly saying to Conrad," was her
reply to a suggestion of Sally's that she wanted change and rest.
"Only this very morning, when he came into my room to see that I had
fresh-made toast&mdash;because you know, my dear, how tiresome servants
are about toast&mdash;they make it overnight, and warm it up in the
morning. Cook is no exception, and I have complained till I'm tired.
I should be sorry to change, she's been here so long, but I did hear
the other day of such a nice respectable person...."</p>

<p>Sally interrupted, catching at a slight pause: "But when Dr.&nbsp;Conrad
came into your room, what did he say?"</p>

<p>"My dear, I was going to tell you." She paused, with closed eyes and
folded hands of aggressive patience, for all trace of human
interruption to die down; then resumed: "I said to Conrad: 'I think
you might have thought of that before.' And then he was sorry. I
will do him that justice. My dear boy has his faults, as I know too
well, but he is always ready to admit he is wrong."</p>

<p>"We can get you lodgings, you know," said Sally, from sheer
intuition, for she had not a particle of information, so far, about
what passed over the toast. The old lady seemed to think the
conversation had been sufficiently well filled out, for she merely
said, "Facing the sea," and went on knitting.</p>

<p>Sally and her mother knew St.&nbsp;Sennan well&mdash;had been at his
watering-place twice before&mdash;so she was able, as it were, to
forecast lodgings on the spot. "I dare say Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden's is
vacant," she said. "I wish you could have hers, she's such a nice
old body. Her husband was a pilot, and she has one son a coastguard
and another in the navy. And one daughter has no legs, but can do
shell-work; and the other's married a tax-collector."</p>

<p>But Goody Vereker was not going to be beguiled into making herself
agreeable. She took up the attitude that Sally was young, and easily
deceived. She threw a wet blanket over her narrative of the Iggulden
family, and ignored any murmurs that came from beneath it.
"Sea-faring folk are all alike," so she said. "When I was your age,
my dear, I simply worshipped them. My father and all his brothers
were devoted to the sea, and my Uncle David published an account of
his visit to the Brazils. But you will learn by experience. At any
rate, I trust there are no vermin. That

<!-- Page 307 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
is always my terror in
these lodging-houses, and ill-aired beds."</p>

<p>Was it fair, Sally thought to herself, to expose that dear old Mrs.
Iggulden, who lived in a wooden dwelling covered with tar, between
two houses built of black shiny bricks, but consisting chiefly of
bay-windows with elderly visitors in them looking through telescopes
at the shipping, and telling the credulous it was brigs or
schooners&mdash;was it fair to expose Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden to this
gilt-spectacled lob-worm? Sally didn't know that Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden could
show a proper spirit, because in her own case the conditions had
never been favourable. They had practised no incantations.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker. As soon as ever mamma and I have
shaken down, we'll see about Iggulden's; and if they can't take you
somebody else will."</p>

<p>"I am in your hands," said the Goody, smiling faintly and
submissively. She leaned back with her eyes closed, and was afraid
she had done too much. She used to have periodical convictions to
that effect.</p>

<p>Sally had an appointment with L&aelig;titia Wilson at the swimming bath,
so the Goody, in an access of altruism, perceived that she mustn't
keep her. She herself would try to rest a little.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>All people, as we suppose, lead two lives, more or less&mdash;their outer
life, that of the world and action, and an inner life they have all
to themselves. But how different is the proportion of the two lives
in different subjects! And how much less painful the latter life is
when we feel we could tell it all if we chose. Only we don't choose,
because it's no concern of yours or any one else's.</p>

<p>This was Sally's frame of mind. She would not have felt the ghost of
a reserve of an inmost thought (from her mother, for instance) in
the face of questions asked, though she kept her own counsel about
many points whose elucidation was not called for. It may easily be
that Rosalind asked no questions about some things, because she had
no wish that her daughter should formulate their answers too
decisively. Her relation with Conrad Vereker, for example. Was it
love, or what? If there was to be marrying, and families, and that
sort of thing, and possible interference

<!-- Page 308 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
with swimming-matches and
athletics, and so on, would she as soon choose this man for her
accomplice as any other she knew? Suppose she was to hear to-morrow
that Dr.&nbsp;Vereker was engaged to Sylvia Peplow, would she be glad or
sorry?</p>

<p>Rosalind certainly did ask no such questions. If she had, the
answers to the first two would have been, we surmise, very clear and
decisive. What nonsense! Fancy Prosy being in love with anybody, or
anybody being in love with Prosy! And as for marrying, the great
beauty of it all was that there was to be no marrying. Did he
understand that? Oh dear, yes! Prosy understood quite well. But we
wonder, is the image our mind forms of Sally's answer to the third
question correct or incorrect? It presents her to us as answering
rather petulantly: "Why <i>shouldn't</i> Dr.&nbsp;Conrad marry Miss Peplow, if
he likes, and <i>she</i> likes? I dare say <i>she'd</i> be ready enough,
though!" and then pretending to look out of the window. And shortly
afterwards: "I suppose Prosy has a right to his private affairs, as
much as I have to mine." But with lips that tighten over her speech,
without a smile. Note that this is all pure hypothesis.</p>

<p>But she had nothing to conceal that she knew of, had Sally. What a
difference there was between her inner world and her mother's, who
could not breathe a syllable of that world's history to any living
soul!</p>

<p>Rosalind acknowledged to herself now how great the relief had been
when, during the few hours that passed between her communication to
her old friend on his deathbed and the last state of insensibility
from which he never rallied, there had actually been on this earth
one other than herself who knew all her story and its strange
outcome. For those few hours she had not been alone, and the memory
of it helped her to bear her present loneliness. She could hear
again, when she woke in the stillness of the night, the voice of the
old man, a whisper struggling through his half-choked respiration,
that said again and again: "Oh, Rosey darling! can it be true? Thank
God! thank God!" And the fact that what she had then feared had
never come to pass&mdash;the fact that, contrary to her expectations, he
had been strangely able to look the wonder in the face, and never
flinch from it, seeing nothing in it but a priceless boon&mdash;this fact
seemed to give her now the fortitude to bear without help the burden
of her knowledge&mdash;the

<!-- Page 309 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
knowledge of who he was, this man that was
beside her in the stillness, this man whose steady breathing she
could hear, whose heart-beats she could count. And her heart dwelt
on the old soldier's last words, strangely, almost incredibly,
resonant, a hard-won victory in his dying fight for speech, "Evil
has turned to good. God be praised!" It had almost seemed as if the
parting soul, on the verge of the strangest chance man has to face,
lost all measure of the strangeness of any earthly thing, and was
sensible of nothing but the wonderment of the great cause of all.</p>

<p>But one thing that she knew (and could not explain) was that this
secret knowledge, burdensome in itself, relieved the oppression of
one still more burdensome, and helped her to drive it from her
thoughts. We speak of the collision of the record in her mind of
what her daughter was, and whence, with the fact that Sally was
winding herself more and more, daughterwise, round the heart of the
man whose bond with her mother she, small and unconscious, had had
so large a share in rending asunder twenty years ago. It was to her,
in its victory over crude physical fact, even while it oppressed
her, a bewildering triumph of spirit over matter, of soul over
sense, this firm consolidating growth of an affection such as Nature
means, but often fails to reach, between child and parent. And as it
grew and grew, her child's actual paternity shrank and dwindled,
until it might easily have been held a matter for laughter, but for
the black cloud of Devildom that hung about it, and stamped her as
the infant of a Nativity in the Venusberg, whose growing after-life
had gone far to shroud the horror of its lurid caverns with a veil
of oblivion.</p>

<p>We say all these things quite seriously of our Sally, in spite of
her incorrigible slanginess and vulgarity. We can now go on to St.
Sennans-on-Sea, where we shall find her in full blow, but very
sticky with the salt water she passes really too much of her time
in, even for a merpussy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p class="subhead">ST. SENNANS-ON-SEA. MISS GWENDOLEN ARKWRIGHT. WOULD ANY OTHER CHILD
HAVE BEEN SALLY? HOW MRS. IGGULDEN'S COUSIN SOLOMON SURRENDERED HIS&nbsp;COUCH</p>

<p>St.&nbsp;Sennans-on-Sea consists of two parts&mdash;the new and the old. The
old part is a dear little old place, and the new part is beastly. So
Sally says, and she must know, because this is her third visit.</p>

<p>The old part consists of Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden's and the houses we have
described on either side of her, and maybe two dozen more wooden or
black-brick dwellings of the same sort; also of the beach and its
interesting lines of breakwater that are so very jolly to jump off
or to lie down and read novels under in the sea smell. Only not too
near the drains, if you know it. If you don't know it, it doesn't
matter so much, because the smell reminds you of the seaside, and
seems right and fitting. You must take care how you jump, though,
off these breakwaters, because where they are not washed
inconceivably clean, and all their edges smoothed away beyond belief
by the tides that come and go for ever, they are slippery with green
sea-ribbons that cling close to them, and green sea-fringes that
cling closer still, and brown sea-ramifications that are studded
with pods that pop if you tread on them, but are not quite so
slippery; only you may just as well be careful, even with them. And
we should recommend you, before you jump, to be sure you are not
hooked over a bolt, not merely because you may get caught, and fall
over a secluded reading-public on the other side, but because the
red rust comes off on you and soils your white petticoat.</p>

<p>If you don't mind jumping off these breakwaters&mdash;and it really is
rather a lark&mdash;you may tramp along the sea front quite near up to
where the fishing-luggers lie, each with a capstan all to itself,
under the little extra old town the red-tanned fishing-nets live in,
in houses that are like sailless windmill-tops whose plank

<!-- Page 311 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
walls
have almost merged their outlines in innumerable coats of tar, laid
by long generations back of the forefathers of the men in oil-cloth
head-and-shoulder hats who repair their nets for ever in the Channel
wind, unless you want a boat to-day, in which case they will scull
you about, while you absolutely ache sympathetically with their
efforts, of which they themselves remain serenely unaware, till
you've been out long enough. Then they beach you cleverly on the top
of a wave, and their family circle seizes you, boat and all, and
runs you up the shingle before the following wave can catch you and
splash you, which it wants to do.</p>

<p>There is an aroma of the Norman Conquest and of Domesday Book about
the old town. Research will soon find out, if she looks sharp, that
there is nothing Norman in the place except the old arch in the
amorphous church-tower, and a castle at a distance on the flats. But
the flavour of the past is stronger in the scattered memories of
bygone sea-battles not a century ago, and the names of streets that
do not antedate the Georges, than in these mere scraps that are
always open to the reproach of medi&aelig;valism, and are separated from
us by a great gulf. And it doesn't much matter to us whether the
memories are of victory or defeat, or the names those of sweeps or
heroes. All's one to us&mdash;we glow; perhaps rashly, for, you see, we
really know very little about them. And he who has read no history
to speak of, if he glows about the past on the strength of his
imperfect data, may easily break his molasses-jug.</p>

<p>So, whether our blood is stirred by Nelson and Trafalgar, whereof we
have read, or by the Duke of York and Walcheren, whereof we
haven't&mdash;or mighty little&mdash;we feel in touch with both these heroes,
for they are modern. Both have columns, anyhow; and we can dwell
upon their triumph or defeat almost as if it wasn't history at all,
but something that really happened, without running any risk of
being accused of archaism or of deciphering musty tomes. And we can
enjoy our expedition all the same to the ruined keep in the level
pastures, where the long-horned black cattle stand and think and
flap their tails still, just as they did in the days when the
basement dungeons, now choked up, held real prisoners with real
broken hearts.</p>

<p>But there is modern life, too, at St.&nbsp;Sennans&mdash;institutions that
keep

<!-- Page 312 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
abreast of the century. Half the previous century ago, when we
went there first, the Circulating Library consisted, so far as we
can recollect it, of a net containing bright leather balls, a
collection of wooden spades and wheelbarrows, a glass jar with
powder-puffs, another with tooth-brushes, a rocking-horse&mdash;rashly
stocked in the first heated impulse of an over-confident founder&mdash;a
few other trifles, and, most important of all, a book-case that
supplied the title-r&ocirc;le to the performance. That book-case contained
(we are confident) <i>editiones principes</i> of Mrs.&nbsp;Ratcliff, Sir
Walter Scott, Bulwer Lytton, Currer Bell ... well, even Fanny
Burney, if you come to that. There certainly was a copy of
"Frankenstein," and fifty years ago our flesh was so compliant as to
creep during its perusal. It wouldn't now.</p>

<p>But even fifty years ago there was never a volume that had not been
defaced out of all knowledge by crooked marks of the most
inquisitive interrogation, and straight marks of the most indignant
astonishment, by the reading-public in the shadows of the
breakwaters. It really read, that public did; and, what's more, it
often tore out the interesting bits to take away. I remember great
exasperation when a sudden veil was drawn over the future of two
lovers just as the young gentleman had flung himself into the arms
of the young lady. An unhallowed fiend had cut off the sequel with
scissors and boned it!</p>

<p>That was done, or much of it, when the books were new, and the
railway-station was miles away; when the church wasn't new, but old,
which was better. It has been made new since, and has chairs in it,
and memorial windows by Stick and&nbsp;Co. In those days its Sunday-folk
were fisherfolk mostly, and a few local magnates or
parvates&mdash;squirophants, they might be called&mdash;and a percentage of
the visitors.</p>

<p>Was St.&nbsp;Sennan glad or sorry, we wonder, when the last two sorts
subscribed and restored him? If we had been he, one of us would have
had to have the temper of a saint to keep cool about it. Anyhow,
it's done now, and can't be undone.</p>

<p>But the bathing-machines are not restored, at any rate. Those
indescribables yonder, half rabbit-hutch, half dry-dock&mdash;a long row
for ladies and a short one for gentlemen, three hundred yards
apart&mdash;couldn't trust 'em any nearer, bless you!&mdash;these
superannuated God-knows-whats, struggling against disintegration
from

<!-- Page 313 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
automatic plunges down a rugged beach, and creaking journeys
back you are asked to hold on through&mdash;it's no use going on
drying!&mdash;these tributes to public decorum you can find no room in,
and probably swear at&mdash;no sacrilegious restorer has laid his hand on
these. They evidently contemplate going on for ever; for though
their axes grow more and more oblique every day, their
self-confidence remains unshaken. But then they think they <i>are</i> St.
Sennans, and that the wooden houses are subordinate accidents, and
the church a mere tributary that was a little premature&mdash;got there
first, in its hurry to show respect for <i>them</i>. And no great wonder,
seeing what a figure they cut, seen from a boat when you have a row!
Or, rather, used to cut; for now the new town (which is beastly) has
come on the cliff above, and looks for all the world as if <i>it</i> was
St.&nbsp;Sennans, and speaks contemptuously of the real town as the Beach
Houses.</p>

<p>The new town can only be described as a tidy nightmare; yet it is a
successful creation of the brains that conceived it&mdash;a successful
creation of ground-rents. As a development of land ripe for
building, with more yards of frontage to the main-road than at first
sight geometry seems able to accommodate, it has been taking
advantage of unrivalled opportunities for a quarter of a century,
backed by advances on mortgage. It is the envy of the neighbouring
proprietors east and west along the coast, who have developed their
own eligible sites past all remedy and our endurance, and now have
to drain their purses to meet the obligations to the professional
mortgagee, who is biding his hour in peace, waiting for the fruit to
fall into his mouth and murderously sure of his prey. But at St.
Sennans a mysterious silence reigns behind a local office that
yields keys on application, and answers all inquiries, and asks
ridiculous rents. And this silence, or its keeper, is said to have
become enormously rich over the new town.</p>

<p>The shareholders in the St.&nbsp;Sennans Hotel, Limited, cannot have
become rich. If they had, surely they would provide something better
for a hungry paying supplicant than a scorched greasy chop, inflamed
at the core, and glass bottles containing a little pellucid liquid
that parts with its carbon dioxide before you can effect a
compromise with the cork, which pushes in, but not so as to attain
its ideal. So your Seltzer water doesn't pour

<!-- Page 314 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
fast enough to fizz
outside the bottle, and your heart is sad. Of course, you can have
wine, if you come to that, for look at the wine-list! Only the
company's ideas of the value of wine are not limited, and if you
decide not to be sordid, and order a three-shilling bottle of M&eacute;doc,
you will find its contents to be very limited indeed. But why say
more than that it is an enormous hotel at the seaside? You know all
about them, and what it feels like in rainy weather, when the fat
gentleman has got to-day's "Times," and means to read all through
the advertisement-column before he gives up the leaders, and you
have to spend your time turning over thick and shiny snap-shot
journals with a surfeit of pictures in them; or the Real Lady, or
the Ladylike Lady, or the Titled Lady, the portraits of whom&mdash;one or
other of them&mdash;sweep in curves about their folio pages; and, while
they fascinate you, make you feel that you would falter on the
threshold of matrimony if only because they couldn't possibly take
nourishment. Would not the discomfort of meals eaten with a
companion who could swallow nothing justify a divorce <i>a mensa</i>?</p>

<p>A six-shilling volume might be written about the New Hotel, with an
execration on every page. Don't let us have anything to do with it,
but keep as much as possible at the Sea Houses under the cliff,
which constitute the only St.&nbsp;Sennans necessary to this story. We
shall be able to do so, because when Mrs.&nbsp;and Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick and their
daughter went for a walk they always went up the cliff-pathway,
which had steps cut in the chalk, past the boat upside down, where
new-laid eggs could be bought from a coastguard's wife. And this
path avoided the New Town altogether, and took them straight to the
cliff-track that skirted growing wheat and blazing poppies till you
began to climb the smooth hill-pasture the foolish wheat had
encroached upon in the Protection days, when it was worth more than
South Down mutton. And now every ear of it would have been repenting
in sackcloth and ashes if it had been qualified by Nature to know
how little it would fetch per bushel. But it wasn't. And when, the
day after their arrival, Rosalind and her husband were on the beach
talking of taking a walk up that way when Sally came out, it could
have heard, if it would only have stood still, the sheep-bells on
the slopes above reproaching it, and taunting it

<!-- Page 315 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
with its
usurpation and its fruitless end. Perhaps it was because it felt
ashamed that it stooped before the wind that carried the reproachful
music, and drowned it in a silvery rustle. The barley succeeded the
best. You listen to the next July barley-field you happen on, and
hear what it can do when a breeze comes with no noise of its own.</p>

<p>Down below on the shingle the sun was hot, and the tide was high,
and the water was clear and green close to the shore, and jelly-fish
abounded. You could look down into the green from the last steep
ridge at high-water mark, and if you looked sharp you might see one
abound. Only you had to be on the alert to jump back if a heave of
the green transparency surged across the little pebbles that could
gobble it up before it was all over your feet&mdash;but didn't this time.
Oh dear!&mdash;how hot it was! Sally had the best of it. For the allusion
to Sally's "coming out" referred to her coming out of the water, and
she was staying in a long time.</p>

<p>"That child's been twenty-four minutes already," said her mother,
consulting her watch. "Just look at her out there on the horizon.
What on earth <i>are</i> they doing?"</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> a little inexplicable. At that moment Sally and her
friend&mdash;it was one Fr&auml;ulein Braun, who had learned swimming in the
baths on the Rhone at Geneva and in Paris&mdash;appeared to be nothing
but two heads, one close behind the other, moving slowly on the
water. Then the heads parted company, and apparently their owners
lay on their backs in the water, and kicked up the British Channel.</p>

<p>"They're saving each other's lives," said Gerry. He got up from a
nice intaglio he had made to lie in, and after shaking off a good
bushel of small pebbles a new-made beach-acquaintance of four had
heaped upon him, resorted to a double opera-glass to see them
better. "The kitten wanted me to get out of my depth for her to tow
me in. But I didn't fancy it. Besides, a sensitive British public
would have been scandalised."</p>

<p>"You never learned to swim, then, Gerry&mdash;&mdash;?" She just stopped
herself in time. The words "after all" were on her lips. Without
them her speech was mere chat; with them it would have been a match
to a mine. She sometimes wished in these days that the mine might
explode of itself, and give her peace.</p>

<div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"I suppose I never did," replied her husband, as a matter of course.
"At least, I couldn't do it when I tried in the water just now. I
should imagine I must have tried B.C., or I shouldn't have known how
to try. It's not a thing one forgets, so they say." He paused a few
seconds, and then added: "Anyhow, it's quite certain I couldn't do
it." There was not a trace of consciousness on his part of anything
in <i>her</i> mind beyond what her words implied. But she felt in peril
of fire, so close to him, with a resurrection of an image in it&mdash;a
vivid one&mdash;of the lawn-tennis garden of twenty years ago, and the
speech of his friend, the real Fenwick, about his inability to swim.</p>

<p>This sense of peril did not diminish as he continued: "I've found
out a lot of things I <i>can</i> do in the way of athletics, though; I
seem to know how to wrestle, which is very funny. I wonder where I
learned. And you saw how I could ride at Sir Mountmassingham's last
month?" This referred to a country visit, which has not come into
our story. "And that was very funny about the boxing. Such a
peaceful old fogey as your husband! Wasn't it, Rosey darling?"</p>

<p>"Why won't you call the Bart. by his proper name, Gerry? Wasn't
what?"</p>

<p>"Funny about the gloves. You know that square fellow? He was a
well-known prizefighter that young Sales Wilson had picked up and
brought down to teach the boys. You remember him? He went to church,
and was very devout...."</p>

<p>"I remember."</p>

<p>"Well, it was in the billiard-room, after dinner. He said quite
suddenly, 'This gentleman now can make use of his daddles. I can see
it in him'&mdash;meaning me. 'What makes you think that, Mr.
Macmorrough?' said I. 'We of the fancy, sir,' says he, 'see these
things, without referrin' to no books, by the light of Nature.' And
next day we had a set-to with the gloves, and his verdict was 'Only
just short of professional.' Those boys were delighted. I wonder how
and when I became such a dab at it?"</p>

<p>"I wonder!" Rosalind doesn't seem keen on the subject. "I wish those
crazy girls would begin to think of coming in. If it's going to be
like this every day I shall go home to London, Gerry."</p>

</div>

<p>"Perhaps when Vereker comes down on Monday he'll be able to
influence. Medical authority!"</p>

<p>Here the beach-acquaintance, who had kept up a musical undercurrent
of disjointed comment, perceived an opportunity for joining more
actively in the conversation.</p>

<p>"My mummar says&mdash;my mummar says&mdash;my mummar says...."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;little pet&mdash;what does she say?" Thus Rosalind.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Miss Gwendolen Arkwright&mdash;what does she say?" Thus Fenwick, on
whom Miss Arkwright is seated.</p>

<p>"My mummar says se wissus us not to paggle Tundy when the tideses
goed out. But my mummar says&mdash;my mummar says...."</p>

<p>"Yes, darling."</p>

<p>"My mummar says we must paggle Monday up to here." Miss Arkwright
indicates the exact high-water mark sanctioned, candidly. "Wiv no
sooze, and no stottins!" She then becomes diffuse. "And my bid
sister Totey's doll came out in my bed, and Dane dusted her out wiv
a duster. And I can do thums. And they make free...." At this point
Miss Arkwright's copy runs short, and she seizes the opportunity for
a sort of seated dance of satisfaction at her own eloquence&mdash;a kind
of subjective horsemanship.</p>

<p>"I wish I never had to do any sums that made more than three," is
the putative horse's comment. "But there are only two possible,
alas! And the totals are stale, as you might say."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid my little girl's being troublesome." Thus the mamma,
looking round a huge groin of breakwater a few yards off.</p>

<p>"Troublesome, madame?" exclaims Fenwick, using French unexpectedly.
"She's the best company in Sussex." But Miss Arkwright's nurse Jane
domineers into the peaceful circle with a clairvoyance that Miss
Gwendolen is giving trouble, and bears her away rebellious.</p>

<p>"What a shame!" says Gerry <i>sotto voce</i>. "But I wonder why I said
'madame'!"</p>

<p>"I remember you said it once before." And she means to add "the
first time you saw me," but dubs it, in thought, a needless lie, and
substitutes, "that day when you were electrocuted." And then

<!-- Page 318 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
imagines she has flinched, and adds her original text boldly. She
isn't sorry when her husband merely says, "That was queer too!" and
remains looking through his telescope at the swimmers.</p>

<p>"They're coming at last&mdash;a couple of young monkeys!" is her comment.
And, sure enough, after a very short spell of stylish sidestrokes
Sally's voice and laugh are within hearing ahead of her companion's
more guttural intonation. Her mother draws a long breath of relief
as the merpussy vanishes under her awning, and is shouted and tapped
at to hold tight, while capstan-power tugs and strains to bring her
dressing-room up a sharp slope out of reach of the sea.</p>

<p>"Well, Jeremiah, and what have <i>you</i> got to say for yourself?" said
the merpussy soon after, just out of her machine, with a huge mass
of briny black hair spread out to dry. The tails had to be split and
sorted and shaken out at intervals to give the air a chance. Sally
was blue and sticky all over, and her finger-tips and nails all one
colour. But her spirits were boisterous.</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"What about, indeed? About not coming into the water to be pulled
out. You promised you would, you know you did!"</p>

<p>"I did; but subject to a reasonable interpretation of the compact. I
should have been out of my depth ever so long before you could reach
me. Why didn't you come closer?"</p>

<p>"How could I, with a fat, pink party drying himself next door? <i>You</i>
wouldn't have, if it had been you, and him Goody Vereker...."</p>

<p>"Sal-ly! Darling!" Her mother remonstrates.</p>

<p>"We-ell, there's nothing in that! As if we didn't all know what the
Goody would look like...."</p>

<p>Rosalind is really afraid that the strict mamma of her husband's
recent incubus will overhear, and sit at another breakwater next
day. "<i>Come</i> along!" she says, dispersively and emphatically. "We
shall have the shoulder of mutton spoiled."</p>

<p>"No, we shan't! Shall we, Jeremiah? We've talked it over, me and
Jeremiah. Haven't we, Gaffer Fenwick?" She is splitting up the salt
congestions of his mane as she sits by him on the shingle. He
confirms her statement.</p>

<p>"We have. And we have decided that if we are two hours late

<!-- Page 319 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
it may
be done enough. But that in any case the so-called gravy will be
grey hot water."</p>

<p>"Get up and come along, and don't be a mad kitten! I shall go and
leave you two behind. So now you know." And Rosalind goes away up
the shingle.</p>

<p>"What makes mother look so serious sometimes, kitten? She did just
now."</p>

<p>"She's jealous of you and me flirting like we do. Don't put your hat
on; let the sun dry you up a bit. Does she really look serious
though? Do you mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean it. It comes and goes. But when I ask her she only
laughs at me." A painful thought crosses Sally's mind. Is it
possible that some of her reckless escapades have <i>froiss&eacute;</i>'d her
mother? She goes off into a moment's contemplation, then suddenly
jumps up with, "Come along, Jeremiah," and follows her up the beach.</p>

<p>But the gravity on the face of the latter, by now half-way to the
house, had nothing to do with any of Sally's shocking vulgarities
and outrageous utterances. No, nor even with the green-eyed monster
Jealousy her unscrupulous effrontery had not hesitated to impute.
She allowed it to dominate her expression, as there was no one there
to see, until the girl overtook her. Then she wrenched her face and
her thoughts apart with a smile. "You <i>are</i> a mad little goose,"
said she.</p>

<p>But the thing that weighted her mind&mdash;oppressed or puzzled her, as
might be&mdash;what was it?</p>

<p>Had she been obliged to answer the question off-hand she herself
might have been at a loss to word it, though she knew quite well
what it was. It was the old clash between the cause of Sally and its
result. It was the thought that, but for a memory that every year
seemed to call for a stronger forgetfulness, a more effective
oblivion, this little warm star that had shone upon and thawed a
frozen life, this salve for the wound it sprang from, would have
remained unborn&mdash;a nonentity! Yes, she might have had another
child&mdash;true! But would that child have been Sally?</p>

<p>She was so engrossed with her husband, and he with her, that she
felt she could, as it were, have trusted him with his own identity.
But, then, how about Sally? Though she might with time

<!-- Page 320 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
show him the
need for concealment, how be sure that nothing should come out in
the very confusion of the springing of the mine? She could trust him
with his identity&mdash;yes! Not Sally with hers. Her great surpassing
terror was&mdash;do you see?&mdash;not the effect on <i>him</i> of learning about
Sally's strange <i>provenance</i>, but for Sally herself. The terrible
knowledge she could not grasp the facts without would cast a shadow
over her whole life.</p>

<p>So she thought and turned and looked down on the beach. There below
her was this unsolved mystery sitting in the sun beside the man
whose life it had rent asunder from its mother's twenty years ago.
And as Rosalind looked at her she saw her capture and detain his
hat. "To let his mane dry, I suppose," said Rosalind. "I hope he
won't get a sunstroke." She watched them coming up the shingle, and
decided that they were going on like a couple of school-children.
They were, rather.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Perhaps the image in Sally's profane mind of "hers affectionately,
Rebecca Vereker," before or after an elderly bathe, would not have
appeared there if she had not received that morning a letter so
signed, announcing that, subject to a variety of fulfilments&mdash;among
which the Will of God had quite a conspicuous place&mdash;she and her son
would make their appearance next Monday, as our text has already
hinted. On which day the immature legs of Miss Gwendolen Arkwright
were to be released from a seclusion by which some religious object,
undefined, had been attained the day before.</p>

<p>But the conditions which had to be complied with by the lodgings it
would be possible for this lady to occupy were such as have rarely
been complied with, even in houses built specially to meet their
requirements. Each window had to confront, not a particular quarter,
but a particular ninetieth, of the compass. A full view of the sea
had to be achieved from a sitting-room not exposed to its glare, an
attribute destructive of human eyesight, and fraught with curious
effects on the nerves. But the bedrooms had to look in directions
foreign to human experience&mdash;directions from which no wind ever came
at night. A house of which every story rotated on an independent
vertical axis might have answered&mdash;nothing else would. Even then
space would have

<!-- Page 321 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
called for modification, and astronomy and
meteorology would have had to be patched up. Then with regard to the
different levels of the floors, concession was implied to "a flat";
but, stairways granted, the risers were to be at zero, and the
treads at boiling-point&mdash;a strained simile! As to cookery, the
services of a <i>chef</i> with great powers of self-subordination seemed
to be pointed at, a <i>cordon-bleu</i> ready to work in harness. Hygienic
precautions, such as might have been insisted on by an Athanasian
sanitary inspector on the premises of an Arian householder, were
made a <i>sine qua non</i>. Freedom from vibration from vehicles was so
firmly stipulated for that nothing short of a balloon from
Shepherd's Bush could possibly have met the case. The only
relaxation in favour of the possible was a diseased readiness to
accept shakedowns, sandwiches standing, cuts off the cold mutton,
and snacks generally on behalf of her son.</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden, who was empty both sets on Monday, didn't answer in
any one particular to any of these requisitions. But a spirit of
overgrown compromise crept in, making a sufficient number of reasons
why no one of them could be complied with an equivalent of
compliance itself. Only in respect of certain racks and tortures for
the doctor was Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden induced to lend herself to dangerous
innovation. "I can't have poor Prosy put to sleep in a bed like
this," said Sally, punching in the centre of one, and finding a
hideous cross-bar. Either Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden's nephew must saw it out,
and tighten up the sacking from end to end, or she must get a
Christian bed. Poor Prosy! Whereon Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden explained that her
nephew had by an act of self-sacrifice surrendered this bed as a
luxury for lodgers in the season, having himself a strong congenital
love of bisection. He hadn't slept nigh so sound two months past,
and the crossbar would soothe his slumbers.</p>

<p>So it was finally settled that the Goody and her son should come to
Iggulden's. The question of which set she should occupy being left
open until she should have inspected the stairs. Thereon Mrs.
Iggulden's nephew, whose name was Solomon, contrived a chair to
carry the good lady up them; which she, though faint, declined to
avail herself of when she arrived, perhaps seeing her way to greater
embarrassment for her species by being supported slowly upstairs
with a gasp at each step, and a moan at intervals.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
However, she was
got up in the end, and thought she could take a little milk with a
teaspoonful of brandy in it.</p>

<p>But as to giving any conception of the difficulties that arose at
this point in determining the choice between above and below, that
must be left to your imagination. A conclusion <i>was</i> arrived at in
time&mdash;in a great deal of it&mdash;and the Goody was actually settled on
the ground floor at Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden's, and contriving to battle
against collapse from exhaustion with an implication that she had no
personal interest in reviving, but would do it for the sake of
others.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p class="subhead">HOW SALLY PUT THE FINISHING TOUCH ON THE DOCTOR, WHO COULDN'T SLEEP.
OF THE GRAND DUKE OF HESSE-JUNKERSTADT. AND OF AN INTERVIEW
OVERHEARD</p>

<p>Fenwick was not a witness of this advent, as the Monday on which it
happened had seen his return to town. He had had his preliminary
week, and his desk was crying aloud for him. He departed, renewing a
solemn promise to write every day as the train came into the little
station at Egbert's Road, for St.&nbsp;Sennans and Growborough. It is
only a single line, even now, to St.&nbsp;Sennans from here, but as soon
as it was done it was good-bye to all peace and quiet for St.
Sennan.</p>

<p>Rosalind and her daughter came back in the omnibus&mdash;not the one for
the hotel, but the one usually spoken of as Padlock's&mdash;the one that
lived at the Admiral Collingwood, the nearest approach to an inn in
the old town. The word "omnibus" applied to it was not meant
literally by Padlock, but only as a declaration of his indifference
as to which four of the planet's teeming millions rode in it. This
time there was no one else except a nice old farmer's wife, who
spoke <i>to</i> each of the ladies as "my dear," and <i>of</i> each of them as
"your sister." Rosalind was looking wonderfully young and handsome,
certainly. They secured all the old lady's new-laid eggs, because
there would be Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker in the evening. We like adhering to
these ellipses of daily life.</p>

<p>Next morning Sally took Dr.&nbsp;Vereker for a walk round to show him the
place. Try to fancy the condition of a young man of about thirty,
who had scarcely taken his hand from the plough of general practice
for four years&mdash;for his holidays had been mighty
insignificant&mdash;suddenly inaugurating three weeks of paradise in
<i>the</i> society man most covets&mdash;of delicious seclusion remote from
patients, a happy valley where stethoscopes might be forgotten, and
carbolic acid was unknown, where diagnosis ceased

<!-- Page 324 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
from troubling,
and prognosis was at rest. He got so intoxicated with Sally that he
quite forgot to care if the cases he had left to Mr.&nbsp;Neckitt (who
had been secured as a substitute after all) survived or got
terminated fatally. Bother them and their moist <i>r&acirc;les</i> and cardiac
symptoms, and effusions of blood on the brain!</p>

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Conrad was a young man of an honest and credulous nature, with a
turn for music naturally, and an artificial bias towards medicine
infused into him by his father, who had died while he was yet a boy.
His honesty had shown itself in the loyalty with which he carried
out his father's wishes, and his credulity in the readiness with
which he accepted his mother's self-interested versions of his duty
towards herself. She had given him to understand from his earliest
years that she was an unselfish person, and entitled to be
ministered unto, and that it was the business of every one else to
see that she did not become the victim of her own self-sacrifice. At
the date of this writing her son was passing through a stage of
perplexity about his duty to her in its relation to his possible
duty to a wife undefined. That he might not be embarrassed by too
many puzzles at once, he waived the question of who this wife was to
be, and ignored the fact that would have been palpable to any true
reading of his mind, that if it had not been for Miss Sally
Nightingale this perplexity might never have existed. He satisfied
his conscience on the point by a pretext that Sally was a thing on a
pinnacle out of his reach&mdash;not for the likes of him! He made believe
that he was at a loss to find a foothold on his greasy pole, but was
seeking one in complete ignorance of what would be found at the top
of it.</p>

<p>This shallow piece of self-deception was ripe for disillusionment
when Sally took its victim out for a walk round to show him the
place. It had the feeblest hold on existence during the remainder of
the day, throughout which our medical friend went on dram-drinking,
knowing the dangers of his nectar-draughts, but as helpless against
them as any other dram-drinker. It broke down completely and finally
between moonrise and midnight&mdash;a period that began with Sally
calling under Iggulden's window, "Come out, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad, and see the
phosphorescence in the water; it's going to be quite bright
presently," and ended with, "Good gracious,

<!-- Page 325 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
how late it is! Shan't
we catch it?" an exclamation both contributed to. For it was
certainly past eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>But in that little space it had broken down, that delusion; and the
doctor knew perfectly well, before ten o'clock, certainly, that all
the abstract possible wives of his perplexity meant Sally, and Sally
only. And, further, that Sally was at every point of the
compass&mdash;that she was in the phosphorescence of the sea, and the
still golden colour of the rising moon. That space was full of her,
and that each little wave-splash at their feet said "Sally," and
then gave place to another that said "Sally" again. Poor Prosy!</p>

<p>But what did they <i>say</i>, the two of them? Little enough&mdash;mere merry
chat. But on his part so rigid a self-constraint underlying it that
we are not sure some of the little waves didn't say&mdash;not Sally at
all, but&mdash;Miss Nightingale! And a persistent sense of a thought that
was only waiting to be thought as soon as he should be alone&mdash;that
was going to run somewhat thus: "How could it come about? That this
girl, whom I idolize till my idolatry is almost pain; this girl who
has been my universe this year past, though I would not confess it;
this wonder whom I judge no man worthy of, myself least of all&mdash;that
she should be cancelled, made naught of, hushed down, to be the mate
of a poor G.P.; to visit his patients and leave cards, make up his
little accounts, perhaps! Certainly to live with his mother...." But
he knew under the skin that he would be even with that disloyal
thought, and would stop it off at this point in time to believe he
hadn't thought it.</p>

<p>Still, for all that this disturbing serpent would creep into his
Eden, for all that he would have given worlds to dare a little
more&mdash;that moment in the moonlight, with a glow-flecked water at his
feet and hers, and the musical shingle below, and a sense of Christy
Minstrels singing about Billy Pattison somewhere in the warm
night-air above, and the flash of the great revolving light along
the coast answering the French lights across the great, dark silent
sea&mdash;that moment was the record moment of his life till then. It
would never do to say so to Sally, that was all! But it was true for
all that. For his life had been a dull one, and the only comfort he
could get out of the story of it so far was that at least there was
no black page in it he would like

<!-- Page 326 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
to cut out. Sally might read them
all, and welcome. Their relation to <i>her</i> had become the point to
consider. You see, at heart he was a slow-coach, a milksop, nothing
of the man of the world about him. Well, her race had had a dose of
the other sort in the last generation. Had the breed wearied of it?
Was that Sally's unconscious reason for liking him?</p>

<p>"How very young Prosy has got all of a sudden!" was Sally's
postscript to this interview, as she walked back to their own
lodgings with her mother, who had been relieving guard with the
selfless one while the doctor went out to see the phosphorescence.</p>

<p>"He's like a boy out for a holiday," her mother answered. "I had no
idea Dr.&nbsp;Conrad could manage such a colour as that; I thought he was
pallid and studious."</p>

<p>"Poor dear. <i>We</i> should be pallid and studious if it was cases all
day long, and his ma at intervals."</p>

<p>"Do you know, kitten darling, I can't help thinking perhaps we do
that poor woman an injustice...."</p>

<p>"&mdash;Can't you?" Thus Sally in a parenthetic voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"... and that she really isn't such a very great humbug after all!"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because she would be such a <i>very</i> great humbug, don't you see,
chick?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't she? Somebody must, or there'd be no such thing."</p>

<p>"Why should there be any such thing?"</p>

<p>"Because of the word. Somebody must, or there'd be no one to hook it
to.... Have they stopped, I wonder, or are they going to begin
again?" This referred to the Ethiopian banjos afar. "I do declare
they're going to sing Pesky Jane, and it's nearly twelve o'clock!"</p>

<p>"Never mind <i>them</i>! How came <i>you</i> to know all the vulgar
nigger-songs?... I was going to say. It's very difficult to believe
it's quite all humbug when one hears her talk about her son and his
welfare, and his prospects and...."</p>

<p>"I know what she talked about. When her dear son marries, she's
going to devote herself to him and her dear daughter that will be.
Wasn't that it?"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 327 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Yes; but then she couldn't say more than that all she had would be
theirs, and she would take her to her bosom, etcetera. Could she?"</p>

<p>"She'll have to pull a long way!" The vulgar child's mind has flown
straight to the Goody's outline in profile. She is quite
incorrigible. "But wasn't that what old Mr.&nbsp;Turveydrop said, or very
nearly? Of course, one has to consider the parties and make
allowance."</p>

<p>"Sallykin, what a madcap you are! You don't care <i>what</i> you say."</p>

<p>"We-e-ell! there's nothing in that.... But look here, mammy darling.
Did that good woman in all she said to-night&mdash;all the time she was
jawing&mdash;did she once lose sight of her meritorious attitude?"</p>

<p>"It may only be a <i>fa&ccedil;on de parler</i>&mdash;a sort of habit."</p>

<p>"But it isn't. Jeremiah says so. We've talked it over, us two. He
says he wouldn't like his daughter&mdash;meaning me&mdash;to marry poor Prosy,
because of the Goody."</p>

<p>"Are you sure he meant you? Did you ask him?"</p>

<p>"No, because I wasn't going to twit Jeremiah with being only step.
We kept it dark who was what. But, of course, he meant me. Like a
submarine telegraph." Sally stopped a moment in gravity. Then she
said: "Mother dear!"</p>

<p>"What, kitten?"</p>

<p>"What a pity it is Jeremiah is only step! Just think how nice if
he'd been real. Now, if you'd only met twenty years sooner...."</p>

<p>A nettle to grasp presented itself&mdash;a bad one. Rosalind seized it
bodily. "I shouldn't have had my kitten," she said.</p>

<p>"I see. I should have been somebody else. But that wouldn't have
mattered to me."</p>

<p>"It would have&mdash;to me!" But this is the most she can do in the way
of nettle-grasping. She is glad when St.&nbsp;Sennan, from his tower with
the undoubted piece of Norman, begins to count twelve, and gives her
an excuse for a recall to duty. "Do think how we're keeping poor
Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit up, you unfeeling child!" is her appeal on behalf of
their own fisherman's wife. Sally is just taking note of a finale of
the Ethiop choir. "They've done Pesky Jane, and they're going away
to bed," she says. "How the black

<!-- Page 328 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
must come off on the sheets!" And
then they hurried home to sleep sound.</p>

<p>But there was little sleep for the doctor that night, perhaps
because he had got so young all of a sudden. So it didn't matter
much that his mother countermanded his proposal that bed should be
gone to, on the ground that it was so late now that she wouldn't be
able to sleep a wink. If she <i>could</i> have gone an hour ago it would
have been different. Now it was too late. An aggressive
submissiveness was utilized by the good lady to the end of his
discomfort and that of Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden, who&mdash;perhaps from some
memories of the Norman Conquest hanging about the
neighbourhood&mdash;would never go to bed as long as a light was burning
in the house.</p>

<p>"It is very strange and most unusual, I know," she continued saying
after she had scarified a place to scratch on. "Your great-uncle
Everett Gayler did not scruple to call it phenomenal, and that when
I was the merest child. After eleven no sleep!" She continued her
knitting with tenacity to illustrate her wakefulness. "But I am
glad, dear Conrad, that you forgot about me. You were in pleasanter
society than your old mother's. No one shall have any excuse for
saying I am a burden on my son. No, my dear boy, my wish is that you
shall feel <i>free</i>." She laid aside the knitting needles, and folding
her hands across the outline Sally was to be dragged up, or along,
dropped her eyelids over a meek glare, and sat with a fixed,
submissive undersmile slightly turned towards her son.</p>

<p>"But I thought, mother, as Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick was here...." Slow, slight,
acquiescent nods stopped him; they were enough to derail any speech
except the multiplication-table or the House-that-Jack-built! But
she waited with exemplary patience for certainty that the train had
stopped. Then spoke as one that gives a commission to speech, and
observes its execution at a distance. Her expression remained
immutable. "She is a well-meaning person," said she.</p>

<p>"I didn't know how late it was." Poor Dr.&nbsp;Conrad gives up
self-defence&mdash;climbs down. "The time ran away." It <i>had</i> done so,
there was no doubt about that.</p>

<p>"And you forgot your mother. But Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick is a well-meaning
person. We will say no more about it."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 329 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Whereupon her son, feeling that silence is golden, said nothing. But
he went and kissed her for all that. She said inscrutably: "You
might have kissed me." But whether she was or wasn't referring to
the fact that she had succeeded in negotiating his kiss on the rim
of her spectacles, Conrad couldn't tell. Probably she meant he might
have kissed her before.</p>

<p>There was no doubt, however, about her intention of knitting till
past one in the morning. She did it enlarging on the medical status
of her illustrious uncle, Dr.&nbsp;Everett Gayler, who had just crept
into the conversation. Her son wasn't so sorry for this as Mrs.
Iggulden, who dozed and waked with starts, on principle, outside in
the passage unseen. <i>He</i> could stand at the wide-open window, and
hear the little waves plash "Sally" in the moonlight, and the
counter-music of the down-drawn shingle echo "Sally" back. Sometimes
the pebbles and the water gave place for a moment to the tread of
two persistent walkers up and down&mdash;men who smoked cigars, and
became a little audible and died again at every time of passing.</p>

<p>One time the doctor caught a rise of voice&mdash;though they did not pass
so very near&mdash;that said: "My idea is to stay here till...."</p>

<p>Then at the next turn the same voice grew from inaudibility to ...
"So I arranged with the parson here for to-morrow, and we shall
get...." and died again. At this moment Dr.&nbsp;Everett Gayler was at
the climax of his fame, having just performed tracheotomy on the
Grand Duke of Hesse-Junkerstadt, and been created Knight-Commander
of some Order whose name Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker wasn't sure about.</p>

<p>Next time the men returned, the same voice that seemed to do all the
talking said: "... Expensive, of course, but she hates the idea of a
registry-office." They paused, and the listener heard that the other
voice had said something to which the first replied: "No, not
Grundy. But she had some friends cooked at one, and they said it was
stuffy, and they would sooner have endured twenty short
homilies...."</p>

<p>A wax vesta scratched, blazed, lighted another cigar, and the second
voice said, "Oh&mdash;ah!" and both grew inaudible again.</p>

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Everett Gayler had just pronounced the Grand Duchess's
disease&mdash;they were an afflicted family&mdash;a disease his narrator
couldn't

<!-- Page 330 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
pronounce at all. Most of her bones, in a state of
necrosis, had been skilfully removed by the time the smokers had
passed back. But so much more was Dr.&nbsp;Conrad listening to what the
waves said to the shingle and the shingle answered back, than to
either the Grand Duchess or the registry-office, that it never
crossed his mind whose the voice was who lit the vesta. He heard it
say good-night&mdash;its owner would get back to the hotel&mdash;and the other
make due response. And then nothing was left but the coastguard.</p>

<p>But the Grand Duke's family were not quite done with. It had to be
recorded how many of his distinguished ancestors had suffered from
<i>Plica polonica</i>. Still, the end did come at last, and the worthy
lady thought perhaps if she could lie down now she might drop off.
So Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden got her release and slept.</p>

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Conrad didn't, not a wink. The whole place was full of Sally.
The flashlight at intervals, in couplets, seemed to say "Sally"
twice when it came, and then to leave a blank for him to think about
her in. The great slow steamer far out to sea showed a green eye of
jealousy or a red one of anger because it could not come ashore
where Sally was, but had perforce to go on wherever it was
navigated. The millions of black sea-elves&mdash;did you ever
discriminate them?&mdash;that the slight observer fancies are the
interstices of the moonlight on the water, were all busy about
Sally, though it was hard to follow their movements. And every time
St.&nbsp;Sennan said what o'clock it was, he added, "One hour nearer to
Sally to-morrow!"</p>

<p>Poor Prosy!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF A MARRIAGE BY SPECIAL LICENCE. ROSALIND'S COMPARISONS. OF THE
THREE BRIDESMAIDS, AND HOW THE BRIDE WAS A GOOD SAILOR</p>

<p>But it never occurred to Dr.&nbsp;Vereker that the voice of the smoking
gentleman, whose "<i>she</i>" knew a couple that had been cooked at a
registry office, was a voice quite familiar to him. The only effect
it had on his Sally-dazed mind was to make him wonder four hours
after what it was that kept putting Julius Bradshaw into his head.
If a brain-molecule could have been found not preoccupied with Sally
he might have been able to give her next day a suggestive hint about
a possibility ahead. But never a word said he to Sally; and when, on
her return from bathing the following morning, Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit, the
fisherman's wife, surprised her with the news that "the young lady"
had come and had left her luggage, but would be back in
half-an-hour, she was first taken aback, and thought it was a
mistake next. But no&mdash;no chance of that! The young lady had asked
for Mrs.&nbsp;Algernon Fenwick, or, in default, for Miss Sally, quite
distinctly. She hadn't said any name, but there was a gentleman with
her. Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit seemed to imply that had there been no gentleman
she might have been nameless. Padlock's omnibus they came in.</p>

<p>So Sally went on being taken aback where she had left off, and was
still pondering over the phenomenon when her mother followed her
through the little yard paved with round flints bedded in
mortar&mdash;all except the flower-beds, which were in this case
marigold-beds and fuschia-beds and tamarisk-shakedowns&mdash;and the
street door which always stood open, and it was very little use
ringing, the bell being broken. But you could pass through, and
there would always be old Mr.&nbsp;Lobjoit in the kitchen, even if Mrs.
Lobjoit was not there herself.</p>

<p>"Why not look on the boxes, you stupid kitten? There's a name on
them, or ought to be." Thus Rosalind, after facts told.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 332 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"What a thing it is to have a practical maternal parent!" Thus
Sally. And Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit put on record with an amiable smile that
that is what she kept saying to Miss Nightingale, "Why not look?"
Whereas the fact is Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit never said anything of the sort.</p>

<p>"Here's a go!" says Sally, who gets at the label-side of the trunk
first. "If it isn't Tishy!" And the mother and daughter look at each
other's faces, each watching the other's theory forming of what this
sudden apparition means.</p>

<p>"What do you think, mother?"</p>

<p>"What do <i>you</i> think, kitten?" But the truth is, both wanted time to
know what to think. And they hadn't got much forwarder with the
solution of the problem when a light was thrown upon it by the
sudden apparition of L&aelig;titia herself, accompanied by the young
gentleman whom Sally did not scruple to speak of&mdash;but not in his
presence&mdash;as her counter-jumper. She did this, she said, to "pay
Tishy out" for what she had said about him before she made his
acquaintance.</p>

<p>The couple were in a mixed state of exaltation and confusion&mdash;Tishy
half laughing, a third crying, and a sixth keeping up her dignity.
Both were saying might they come in, and doing it without waiting
for an answer.</p>

<p>Rosalind's remark was one of those nonsequences often met with in
real life: "There's enough lunch&mdash;or we can send out." Sally's was:
"But are you the Julius Bradshaws, or are you not? That's what <i>I</i>
want to know." Sally won't be trifled with, not she!</p>

<p>"Well, Sally dear, no,&mdash;we're not&mdash;not just yet." Tishy hesitates.
Julius shows firmness.</p>

<p>"But we want to be at two o'clock this afternoon, if you'll
come...."</p>

<p>"Both of us?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;of course, both of you."</p>

<p>"Then Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit will have to be in time with lunch." It does not
really matter who were the speakers, nor what the share of each was
in the following aggregate:</p>

<p>"How did you manage to get it arranged?" "Why <i>now</i>? Have you
quarrelled with your mother?" "How long can you be away? I hate a
stingy honeymoon!" "You've got no things." "Do you think

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
they'll
know at home where you are?" "Where are you going afterwards?" "What
do you think your father will say?" "What I want to know is, what
put it into your head <i>now</i>, more than any other time?"</p>

<p>Responses to the whole of which, much at random, are incorporated in
what follows: "Julius isn't wanted for three weeks." "I'm sure the
Professor's on our side, really." "I left a letter to tell them,
anyhow." "Calais. We shan't be sick, in weather like this. We'll
cross by the night boat." "I've got a new dress to be married in,
and a new umbrella&mdash;oh yes, and other things." "I'll tell you the
whole story, Sally dear, as soon as I've had time to turn round."
"No&mdash;not quarrelled&mdash;at least, no more than usual." "Special
licence, of course."</p>

<p>What time Vereker, who had been to the post-office, which sold all
sorts of things, to inquire if they had a packet of chemical oatmeal
(the only thing his mother could digest this morning), and was
coming back baffled, called in on his way to Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden's. Not to
see Sally, but only to take counsel with the family about chemical
oatmeal. By a curious coincident, the moment he heard of Miss Sales
Wilson's arrival, he used Sally's expression, and said that there
was "a go!" Perhaps there was, and that accounted for it.</p>

<p>"Here's Dr.&nbsp;Conrad&mdash;he'll have to come too." Thus Sally explicitly.
To which he replied, "All right. Where?" Sally replied with gravity:
"To see these two married by special licence." And Julius added:
"You <i>must</i> come, doctor, to be my bottle-holder."</p>

<p>A small undercurrent of thought in the doctor's mind, in which he
can still accommodate passing events and the world's trivialities,
begins to receive impressions of the facts of the case. The great
river called Sally flows steadily on, on its own account, and makes
and meddles not. It despises other folk's petty affairs. Dr.&nbsp;Conrad
masters the position, and goes on to draw inferences.</p>

<p>"Then that must have been <i>you</i> last night, Bradshaw?"</p>

<p>"I dare say it was. When?"</p>

<p>"Walking up and down with another fellow in front here. Smoking
cigars, both of you."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you sing out?"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 334 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Well, now&mdash;why didn't I?" He seems a little unable to account for
himself, and no wonder. "I think I recollected it was like you after
you had gone."</p>

<p>"Don't be a brain-case, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad. What would your patients say if
they heard you go on like that?" Sally said this, of course. Her
mother thought to herself that perhaps the patients would send for a
married doctor.</p>

<p>But her mind was taking no strong hold on the current of events,
considering what a very vital human interest was afloat on them. It
was wandering back to another wedding-day&mdash;her own first wedding-day
of twenty years ago. As she looked at this bridegroom&mdash;all his
upspring of hope making light of such fears as needs must be in like
case all the world over&mdash;he brought back to her vividly, for all he
was so unlike him, the face of the much younger man who had met her
that day at Umballa, whose utter freedom from suspicion as he
welcomed her almost made her able to forget the weeks gone by&mdash;the
more so that they were like a dream in Hell, and their sequel like
an awakening in Paradise. Well, at any rate, she had recaptured this
man from Chaos, and he was hers again. And she had Sally. But at the
word the whole world reeled and her feet were on quicksands. What
and whence was Sally?</p>

<p>At least this was true&mdash;there was no taint of her father there!
Sally wasn't an angel&mdash;not a bit of it&mdash;no such embarrassment to a
merely human family. But her mother could see her truth, honour,
purity&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;in every feature, every movement. As
she stood there, giving injunctions to Vereker to look alive or he'd
be late, her huge coil of sea-soaked black hair making her white
neck look whiter, and her white hands reestablishing hair-pins in
the depths of it, she seemed the very incarnation of
non-inheritance. Not a trace of the sire her mother shuddered to
think of in the music of her voice, in the laughter all who knew her
felt in the mirth of her eyebrows and the sparkle of her pearly
teeth. All her identity was her own. If only it could have been
known then that she was going to be Sally!... But how fruitless all
speculation was!</p>

<p>"Perhaps mother knows. Chemical oatmeal, mother, for invalids and
persons of delicate digestion? They haven't got it at Pemberton's."
The eyes and the teeth flash round on her mother,

<!-- Page 335 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
and in a
twinkling the unhallowed shadow of the past is gone. It was only a
moment in all, though it takes more to record it. Rosalind came back
to the life of the present, but she knew nothing about chemical
oatmeal. Never mind. The doctor would find out. And he would be sure
to be in time.</p>

<p>He was in time&mdash;plenty of time, said public opinion. And the couple
were duly married, and went away in Padlock's omnibus to catch the
train for Dover in time for the boat. And Dr.&nbsp;Conrad's eyes were on
the eldest bridesmaid. For, after all, two others were
obtained&mdash;jury-bridesmaids they might be called&mdash;in the persons of
Miss Gwendolen Arkwright and an even smaller sister, who were
somehow commandeered by Sally's enterprise, and bribed with promises
of refreshment. But the smaller sister was an erring sister, for
having been told she was on no account to speak during the service,
she was suddenly struck with the unfairness of the whole thing, and,
pointing at St.&nbsp;Sennans' arch-priest, said very audibly that <i>he</i>
was "peatin'," so why wasn't she to "peat"? However, it was a very
good wedding, and there was no doubt the principals had really
become the Julius Bradshaws. They started from Dover on a sea that
looked like a mill-pond; but Tishy's husband afterwards reported
that the bride sat with her eyes shut the last half of the <i>trajet</i>,
and said, "Don't speak to me, and I shall be all right."</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>That summer night Rosalind and her daughter were looking out over
the reputed mill-pond at the silver dazzle with the elves in it. The
moon had come to the scratch later than last night, from a feeling
of what was due to the almanac, which may (or must) account for an
otherwise enigmatical remark of Sally's, who, when her mother
wondered what time it was, replied: "I don't know&mdash;it's later than
it was yesterday." But did that matter, when it was the sort of
night you stopped out all night on, according to Sally. They came to
an anchor on a seat facing the sea, and adjourned human obligation
<i>sine die</i>.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they've done wisely." Rosalind represents married
thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>Sally shelves misgivings of this sort by reflections on the common
lot of humanity, and considers that it will be the same for them as
every one else.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 336 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"<i>They</i>'ll be all right," she says, with cheerful optimism. "I
wonder what's become of Prosy."</p>

<p>"He's up there with his mother. I saw him at the window. But I
didn't mean that: they'll be happy enough together, I've no doubt. I
mean, has L&aelig;titia done wisely to quarrel with her family?"</p>

<p>"She hasn't; it's only the she-dragon. Tishy told me all about it
going to church."</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>And, oh dear, how poor Prosy, who was up there with his mother, did
long to come out to the voices he could hear plain enough, even as
far off as that! But then he had been so long away to-day, and he
knew his excellent parent always liked to finish the tale of her own
wedding-day when she began it&mdash;as she often did. So he listened
again to the story of the wedding, which was celebrated in the
severest thunderstorm experienced in these islands since the days of
Queen Elizabeth, by a heroic clergyman who was suffering from
pleuro-pneumonia, which made his voice inaudible till a miraculous
chance produced one of Squilby's cough lozenges (which are not to be
had now for love or money), and cured him on the spot. And how the
bridesmaids all had mumps, more or less. And much concerning the
amazingly dignified appearance of her own father and mother, which
was proverbial, and therefore no matter of surprise to any one, the
proverb being no doubt well known to Europe.</p>

<p>But there, it didn't matter! Sally would be there to-morrow.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p class="subhead">HOW A FORTNIGHT PASSED, AND THE HONEYMOONERS RETURNED. OF A CHAT ON
THE BEACH, AND MISS ARKWRIGHT'S SCIENTIFIC EXPERIENCE. ALMOST THE
LAST, LAST, LAST&mdash;MAN'S&nbsp;HEAD!</p>

<p>Sally to-morrow&mdash;and to-morrow&mdash;and to-morrow. Sally for fourteen
morrows. And the moon that had lighted the devoted young man to his
fate&mdash;whatever it was to be&mdash;had waned and left the sky clear for a
new one, on no account to be seen through glass.</p>

<p>They were morrows of inextinguishable, indescribable delight for
their victims or victim&mdash;for how shall we classify Sally? Who shall
tread the inner temple of a girl's mind? How shall it be known that
she herself has the key to the Holy of Holies?&mdash;that she is not
dwelling in the outer court, unconscious of her function of
priestess, its privileges and responsibilities? Or, in plainer
language, metaphors having been blowed in obedience to a probable
wish of the reader's, how do we know Sally was not falling in love
with the doctor? How do we know she was not in love with him
already? How did <i>she</i> know?</p>

<p>All we know is that the morrows went on, each one sweeter than the
last, and all the little incidents went on that were such nothings
at the time, but were so sure to be borne in mind for ever! <i>You</i>
know all about it, you who read. Like enough you can remember now,
old as you are, how you and she (or he, according as your sex is)
got lost in the wood, and never found where the picnic had come to
an anchor till all the wings of chicken were gone and only legs
left; or how there was a bull somewhere; or how next day the cat got
caught on the shoulder of one of you and had to be detached, hooking
horribly, by the other; or how you felt hurt (not jealous, but hurt)
because she (or he) was decently civil to some new he (or she), and
how relieved you were when you heard it was Mr.&nbsp;or Mrs.
Some-name-you've-forgotten. Why, if you were to ask now, of that
grey man or

<!-- Page 338 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
woman whose life was linked with yours, maybe now sixty
years agone, did he or she have a drumstick, or go on to
ham-sandwiches?&mdash;or, was it really a bull, after all?&mdash;or, had that
cat's claws passed out of memory?&mdash;or, what was the name of that
lady (or gentleman) at the So-and-so's?&mdash;if you asked any of these
things, she or he might want a repeat into a deaf ear but would
answer clear enough in the end, and recall the drumsticks and the
equivocal bull, the cat's claws, and the unequivocal married person.
And then you would turn over all the little things of old, and
wrangle a bit over details here and there; and all the while you
would be the very selfsame two that were young and were lost in the
wood and trampled down the fern and saw the squirrels overhead all
those long years ago.</p>

<p>Many a little thing of a like nature&mdash;perhaps some identical&mdash;made
up hours that became days in that fortnight we have to skip, and
then the end was drawing near; and Dr.&nbsp;Conrad would have to go back
and write prescriptions with nothing that could possibly do any harm
in them, and abstain with difficulty from telling young ladies with
cultivated waists they were liars when they said you could get a
loaf of bread between all round, and it was sheer nonsense. And
other little enjoyments of a G.P.'s life. Yes, the end was very
near. But Sally's resolute optimism thrust regrets for the coming
chill aside, and decided to be jolly while we could, and acted up to
its decision.</p>

<p>Besides, an exciting variation gave an interest to the last week of
the doctor's stay at St.&nbsp;Sennans. The wandering honeymooners, in
gratitude to that saint, proposed to pay him a visit on their way
back to London. Perhaps they would stop a week. So the smallest
possible accommodation worthy of the name was found for them over a
brandyball and bull's-eye shop in a house that had no back rooms,
being laid like a vertical plaster against the cliff behind, and
having an exit on a flat roof where you might bask in the sun and
see the bright red poppies growing in the chalk, and contribute your
share towards a settlement of the vexed question of which are brigs.
There wasn't another room to be had in the real St.&nbsp;Sennans, and it
came to that or the hotel (which was beastly), and you might just as
well be in London. Thus Sally, and settled the question.</p>

<p>And this is how it comes to pass that at the beginning of this
chapter&mdash;which

<!-- Page 339 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
we have only just got to, after all this
circumlocution!&mdash;Sally and one of the Julius Bradshaws were sitting
talking on the beach in the shadow of a breakwater, while the other
Julius Bradshaw (the original one) was being taken for a walk to the
extremely white lighthouse three miles off, or nearly five if you
went by the road, by Dr.&nbsp;Conrad, who by this time knew all the walks
in the neighbourhood exactly as well as Sally did, neither more nor
less. And both knew them very well.</p>

<p>The tide had come up quite as far as it had contemplated, and seemed
to have made up its mind this time not to go back in too great a
hurry. It was so nice there on the beach, with Tishy and Sally and
Miss Gwendolen Arkwright, the late bridesmaid, who was having an
independent chat all to herself about the many glories of the
pier-end, and the sights to be seen there by visitors for a penny.
And it&mdash;we are speaking of the tide&mdash;had got a delightful tangle of
floating weed (<i>Fucus Vesiculosus</i>) and well-washed scraps of wood
from long-forgotten wrecks&mdash;who knows?&mdash;and was turning it gently to
and fro, and over and over, with intermittent musical caresses,
against the shingle-bank, whose counter-music spoke to the sea of
the ages it had toiled in vain to grind it down to sand. And the
tide said, wait, we shall see. The day will come, it said, when not
a pebble of you all but shall be scattered drifting sand, unless you
have the luck to be carted up at a shilling a load by permission of
the authorities, to be made into a concrete of a proper consistency
according to the local by-laws. But the pebbles said, please, no; we
will bide our time down here, and you shall have us for your
own&mdash;play with us in the sun at the feet of these two ladies, or
make the whirling shoals of us, beaten to madness, thunder back your
voice when it shouts in the storm to the seaman's wife, who stops
her ears in the dark night alone that she may not hear you heralding
her husband's death. And the tide said very good; but a day would
come when the pebbles would be sand, for all that. And even the
authority would be gone, and the local by-laws. But it would sound
upon some shore for ever. So it kept on saying. Probably it was
mistaken.</p>

<p>This has nothing to do with our story except that it is
approximately the substance of a statement made by Sally to Miss
Arkwright,

<!-- Page 340 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
who was interested, and had been promised it all over
again to-morrow. For the present she could talk about the pier and
take her audience for granted.</p>

<p>"But was it that Kensington Gardens business that did the job?"
asked Sally, in the shadow of the breakwater, getting the black hair
dry after three-quarters of an hour in the sea; because caps, you
know, are all nonsense as far as keeping water out goes. So Sally
had to sit ever so long with it out to dry. And the very tiny
pebbles you can almost see into stick to your hands, as you know,
and come off in your hair when you run them through it, and have to
be combed out. At least, Sally's had. But she kept on running the
pebbles through her still blue fingers for all that as she half lay,
half sat by Tishy on the beach.</p>

<p>"'Did the job!'" repeats the bride on her honeymoon with some
indignation. "Sally dear, when will you learn to be more refined in
your ways of speech? I'm not a <i>pr&eacute;cieuse</i>, but&mdash;'did the job!'
Really, Sally!..."</p>

<p>"Observe the effect of three weeks in France. The Julius Bradshaws
can parlay like anything! No, Tishy darling, don't be a stuck-upper,
but tell me again about Kensington Gardens."</p>

<p>"I told you. It was just like that. Julius and I were walking up the
avenue&mdash;you know...."</p>

<p>"The one that goes up and across, and comes straight like this?"
Tishy, helped by a demonstration of blue finger-tips, recognises
this, strange to say.</p>

<p>"No, not that one. It doesn't matter. We didn't see mamma coming
till she was ever so close, because of the Speke Monument in the
way. And what could possess her to come home that way from Hertford
Street, Mayfair, I cannot imagine!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Tishy dear! It's no use crying over spilled milk. What
did she say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear. She turned purple, and bowed civilly. To Julius, of
course. But it included me, whether or no."</p>

<p>"But was that what did the job?... We-ell, I do not see <i>anything</i>
to object to in that expression. Was it?"</p>

<p>"If you mean, dear, was it that that made us, me and Julius, feel
that matters would get no better by waiting, I think perhaps it
was.... Well, when it comes to meeting one's mother in Kensington
Gardens, near the Speke Monument, and being bowed civilly

<!-- Page 341 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
to, it
seems to me it's high time.... Now, isn't it, Sally?"</p>

<p>Sally evaded giving testimony by raising other questions: "What did
your father say?" "Did the Dragon tell him about the meeting in the
park?" "What do you think he'll say now?"</p>

<p>"Now? Well, you know, I've got his letter. <i>He's</i> all right&mdash;and
rather dear, <i>I</i> think. What do <i>you</i> think, Sally?"</p>

<p>"I think very."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should say very. But with papa you never know. He really
does love us all, after a fashion, except Egerton, only I'm never
sure he doesn't do it to contradict mamma."</p>

<p>"Why don't they chuck each other and have done with it?" The vulgar
child lets fly straight into the bull's-eye; then adds thoughtfully:
"<i>I</i> should, only, then, I'm not a married couple."</p>

<p>Tishy elided the absurd figure of speech and ignored it. The chance
of patronising was not to be lost.</p>

<p>"You are not married, dear. When you are, you may feel things
differently. But, of course, papa and mamma <i>are</i> very odd. I used
to hear them through my door between the rooms at L.B.G. Road. It
was wrangle, wrangle, wrangle; fight, fight, fight; all through the
night&mdash;till two o'clock sometimes. Oh dear!"</p>

<p>"You're sure they always were quarrelling?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, yes. I used to catch all the regular words&mdash;settlement and
principal and prevaricate. All that sort of thing, you know. But
there they are, and there they'll be ten years hence, that's my
belief, living together, sleeping together, and dining at opposite
ends of the same table, and never communicating in the daytime
except through me or Theeny, but quarrelling like cat and dog."</p>

<p>"What shall you do when you go back? Go straight there?"</p>

<p>"I think so. Julius thinks so. After all, papa's the master of the
house&mdash;legally, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Shall you write and say you're coming?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Just go and take our chance. We shan't be any nearer if we
give mamma an opportunity of miffing away somewhere when we come.
What <i>is</i> that little maid talking about there?" The ex-bridesmaid
is three or four yards away, and is discoursing eloquently, a word
in the above conversation having reminded

<!-- Page 342 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
her of a tragic event she
has mentioned before in this story. "I seeps with my bid sister
Totey's dolly," is what she appears to be saying.</p>

<p>"Never mind the little poppet, Tishy, till you've told me more about
it." Sally is full of curiosity. "Did that do the job or did it not?
That's what I want to know."</p>

<p>"I suppose it did, dear, indirectly. That was on Saturday afternoon.
Next morning we breakfasted under a thundercloud with Egerton
grinning inside his skin, and looking like 'Won't you catch it,
that's all!' at me out of the corner of his eye. That was bad
enough, without one's married sister up from the country taking one
aside to say that <i>she</i> wasn't going to interfere, and calling one
to witness that <i>she</i> had said nothing so far. All she said was, 'Me
and mamma settle it between us.' 'Settle what?' said I; and she
didn't answer, and went away to the first celebration."</p>

<p>"She's not bad, your married sister," Sally decided thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh no, Clarissa's not bad. Only she wants to run with the hare and
explain to the hounds when they come up.... What happened next? Why,
as I went upstairs past papa's room, out comes mamma scarlet with
anger, and restraining herself in the most offensive way for me to
go past. I took no notice, and when she was gone I went down and
walked straight into the library. I said, 'What is it, papa?' I saw
he was chuckling internally, as if he'd made a hit."</p>

<p>"Wasn't he angry? What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, <i>he</i> wasn't angry. Let's see ... oh!... what he said was,
'That depends so entirely on what <i>it</i> is, my dear. But, broadly
speaking, I should say it was your mother.' 'What has she been
saying to you?' I asked. And he answered, 'I can only give her exact
words without pledging myself to their meaning. She stated that she
"supposed I was going to tell my daughter I approved of her walking
about Kensington Gardens with <i>that man's</i> arm around her waist." I
replied&mdash;reasonably, as it seems to me&mdash;that I supposed that man was
there himself. Otherwise, it certainly did seem to me a most
objectionable arrangement, and I hope you'll promise your mother not
to do it again.'"</p>

<p>"What on earth did he mean?"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 343 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"You don't understand papa. He quibbles to irritate mamma. He meant
like a waistband&mdash;separate&mdash;don't you see?"</p>

<p>"I see. But it wouldn't bend right." Sally's truthful nature
postpones laughing at the Professor's absurdity; looks at the case
on its merits. When she has done justice to this point, she laughs
and adds: "What did <i>you</i> say, Tishy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I said what nonsense, and it wasn't tight round like all that;
only a symptom. And we didn't even know mamma was there because of
Speke and Grant's obelisk. There wasn't a soul! Papa saw it quite as
I did, and was most reasonable. So I thought I would feel my way to
developing an idea we had been broaching, Julius and I, just that
very time by the obelisk. I asked papa flatly what he would do if I
married Julius straight off. 'I believe, my dear,' said he, 'that I
should be bound to disapprove most highly of your conduct and his.'
'But <i>should</i> you, papa?' I said. 'I should be <i>bound</i> to, my dear,'
said he. 'But should you turn us out of the house?' I asked. 'Most
certainly <i>not</i>,' said he emphatically. 'But I should disapprove.' I
said I should be awfully sorry for that. 'Of course you would,' said
he. 'Any dutiful daughter would. But I don't exactly see what harm
it would do <i>you</i>.' And you see how his letter begins&mdash;that he is
bound, as a parent, to feel the strongest disapprobation, and so on.
No, I don't think we need be frightened of papa. As for mamma, of
course it wouldn't be reasonable to expect her to...."</p>

<p>"To expect her to what?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was going to say keep her hair on. The expression is
Egerton's, and I'm sorry to say his expressions are not always
ladylike, however telling they are! So I hesitated. Now what <i>is</i>
that baby talking about down there?"</p>

<p>For through the whole of Tishy's interesting tale that baby had been
dwelling on the shocking occurrence of her sister's doll as before
recorded. Her powers of narrative&mdash;giving a dramatic form to all
things, and stimulated by Sally's statements of what the beach said
to the sea, and the sea said back&mdash;had, it seemed, attracted shoals
of fish from the ocean depths to hear her recital of the tragedy.</p>

<p>"Suppose, now, you come and tell it us up here, Gwenny," says the
bride to the bridesmaid. And Sally adds: "Yes, delicious

<!-- Page 344 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
little
Miss Arkwright, come and tell us all about it too." Whereupon Miss
Arkwright's musical tones are suddenly silent, and her eyes, that
are so nearly the colour of the sea behind her, remain fixed on her
two petitioners, their owner not seeming quite sure whether she
shall acquiesce, or coquette, or possibly even burst into tears. She
decides, however, on compliance, coming suddenly up the beach on all
fours, and exclaiming, "Tate me!" flings herself bodily on Sally,
who welcomes her with, "You sweet little darling!" while Mrs.&nbsp;Julius
Bradshaw, anticipating requisition, looks in her bag for another
chocolate. They will spoil that child between them.</p>

<p>"Now tell us about the fisses and dolly," says Sally. But the
narrator, all the artist rising in her soul, will have everything in
order.</p>

<p>"I <i>told</i> ze fisses," she says, reproach in her voice.</p>

<p>"I see, ducky. You told the fishes, and now you'll tell us all about
dolly."</p>

<p>"I seeps wiv dolly, because my bid sister Totey said 'Yes.' Dolly
seeps in her fings. I seep in my nightgown. Kean from the wass&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How nice you must be! Well, then, what next?" Sally may be said to
imbibe the narrator at intervals. Tishy calls her a selfish girl.
"You've got her all to yourself," she says. The story goes on:</p>

<p>"I seep vethy thound. Papa seeps vethy thound. Dolly got between the
theets and the blangticks, and came out. It was a dood dob. Dane
<i>said</i> it <i>was</i>&mdash;a dood dob!"</p>

<p>"What did Jane say was a good job? Poor dolly coming out?" A long,
grave headshake denies this. The constructive difficulties of the
tale are beyond the young narrator's skill. She has to resort to
ellipsis.</p>

<p>"Or I sood have been all over brang and sawduss. Dane <i>said</i> so."</p>

<p>"Don't you see, Sally," says Tishy, "dolly was in another
compartment&mdash;the other side of the sheet." But Sally says, of
course, <i>she</i> understands, perhaps even suspects Tishy of claiming
more acquaintance with children than herself because she has been
married three weeks. This isn't fair patronising.</p>

<p>"Dolly came out at ve stisses"&mdash;so the sad tale goes on&mdash;"and tyed,

<!-- Page 345 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
dolly did. Dane put her head on to ty wiv my pocket-hanshtiff!"</p>

<p>"I see, you little ducky, of course her head had come off, and she
couldn't cry till it was put on, was that it? Don't dance, but say
yes or no." This referred to a seated triumphal dance the chronicler
indulged in at having put so much safely on record. Having subsided,
she decided on <i>zass</i> as the proper thing to say, but it took time.
Then she added suddenly: "But I <i>told</i> ze fisses." Sally took a good
long draught, and said: "Of course you did, darling. You shan't be
done out of that!" But an addendum or appendix was forthcoming.</p>

<p>"My mummar says I must tate dolly to be socked for a penny where the
man is wiv buttons&mdash;and the man let Totey look froo his pyglass, and
see all ve long sips, sits miles long&mdash;and I shall see when I'm a
glowed-up little girl, like Totey."</p>

<p>"Coastguard's telescope, evidently," says Sally. "The man up at the
flagstaff. Six miles long is how far off they were, not the length
of the ships at all."</p>

<p>"I saw that. But what on earth were the socks? Does his wife sell
doll's clothes?"</p>

<p>"We must try to find that out." And Sally sets herself to the task.
But it's none so easy. Some mystery shrouds the approach to this
passage in dolly's future life. It is connected with "kymin up," and
"tandin' on a tep," and when it began it went wizzy, wizzy, wizz,
and e-e-e-e, and never stopped. But Gwendolen had not been alarmed
whatever it was, because her "puppar" was there. But it was
exhausting to the intellect to tell of, for the description ended
with a musical, if vacuous, laugh, and a plunge into Sally's bosom,
where the narrator remained chuckling, but quite welcome.</p>

<p>"So Gwenny wasn't pitened! What a courageous little poppet! I wonder
what on earth it was, Sally."</p>

<p>Thus Tishy, at a loss. But Sally is sharper, for in a moment the
solution dawns upon her.</p>

<p>"What a couple of fools we are, Tishy dear! It wasn't <i>socks</i>&mdash;it
was <i>shocks</i>. It was the galvanic battery at the end of the pier. A
penny a time, and you mustn't have it on full up, or you howl. Why
on earth didn't we think of that before?"</p>

<p>But Nurse Jane comes in on the top of the laughter that follows,

<!-- Page 346 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
which Miss Gwendolen is joining in, rather claiming it as a triumph
for her own dramatic power. She demurs to removal, but goes in the
end on condition that all present shall come and see dolly
galvanised at an early date. Jane agrees to replace dolly's vitals
and sew her up to qualify her for this experience. And so they
depart.</p>

<p>"What a dear little mite!" says Mrs.&nbsp;Julius; and then they let the
mite lapse, and go back to the previous question.</p>

<p>"No, Sally dear, mamma will be mamma to the end of the time. But I
didn't tell you all papa said, did I?"</p>

<p>"How on earth can <i>I</i> tell, Tishy dear? You had got to 'any dutiful
daughter would,' etcetera. Cut along! Comes of being in love, I
suppose." This last is a reflection on the low state of Tishy's
reasoning powers.</p>

<p>"Well, just after that, when I was going to kiss him and go, papa
stopped me, and said he had something to say, only he mustn't be too
long because he had to finish a paper on, I think, 'Some Technical
Terms in use in Cnidos in the Sixth Century, B.C.' Or was it...?"</p>

<p>"That was it. That one'll do beautifully. Go ahead!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;of course it doesn't matter. It was like papa, anyhow.... Oh,
yes&mdash;what he said then! It was about Aunt Priscilla's thousand
pounds. He wanted to repeat that the interest would be paid to me
half-yearly if by chance I married Julius or any other man without
his consent. 'I wish it to be distinctly understood that if you
marry Bradshaw it will be against my consent. But I only ask you to
promise me this, L&aelig;titia, that you won't marry any other man against
my consent at present.' I promised, and he said I was a dutiful
daughter. There won't be any trouble with papa."</p>

<p>"Don't look like it! I say, Tishy, that thousand pounds is very
nice. How much will you have? Forty pounds a year?"</p>

<p>"It's more than that. It's gone up, somehow&mdash;sums of money do&mdash;or
down. They're never the same as at first. I'm so glad about it. It's
not as if I brought Julius absolutely nothing."</p>

<p>"How much is it?" Sally is under the impression that sums of money
that exist on the word of signed documents only, and whose
materialisation can only be witnessed by bankers, are like
fourpence, one of whose properties is that it <i>is</i> fourpence. They
are

<!-- Page 347 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
not analogous, and L&aelig;titia is being initiated into the higher
knowledge.</p>

<p>"Well, dear, you see the stock has gone up, and it's at six
three-quarters. You must ask Julius. He can do the arithmetic."</p>

<p>"Does that mean it's sixty-seven pounds ten?"</p>

<p>"You'd better ask Julius. Then, you know, there's the interest."
Sally asked what interest. "Why, you see, Aunt Priscilla left it to
me eleven years ago, so there's more." But a vendor of mauve and
magenta woollen goods, known to Sally as "the beach-woman," was
working up towards them.</p>

<p>"That woman never goes when she comes," said Sally. "Let's get up
and go!"</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>We like lingering over this pleasant little time. It helps on but
little, if at all, with our story. But in years to come this young
couple, who only slip into it by a side-chance, having really little
more to do with it than any of the thousand and one collaterals that
interest the lives of all of us, and come and go and are
forgotten&mdash;this Julius and L&aelig;titia will talk of the pleasant three
days or so they had at St.&nbsp;Sennans when they came back from France.
And we, too, having choice of how much we shall tell of those three
or four days, are in little haste to leave them. Those hours of
unblushing idleness under a glorious sun&mdash;idleness fostered and
encouraged until it seems one great exertion to call a fly, and
another to subside into it&mdash;idleness on matchless moonlight nights,
on land or on water&mdash;idleness with an affectation of astronomical
study, just up to speculating on the identity of Aldebaran or
Arcturus, but scarcely equal to metaphysics&mdash;idleness that lends
itself readily to turning tables and automatic writing, and gets
some convincing phenomena, and finds out that so-and-so is an
extraordinary medium&mdash;idleness that says that letter will do just as
well to-morrow, and Smith must wait&mdash;such hours as these
disintegrate the moral fibre and an&aelig;sthetize our sense of
responsibility, and make us so oblivious of musical criticism that
we accept brass bands and inexplicable serenaders, white or black,
and even accordions and hurdy-gurdies, as intrinsic features of the
<i>ensemble</i>&mdash;the <i>fengshui</i> of the time and place&mdash;and give them a
penny if we've got one.</p>

<p>That is and will be Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Julius Bradshaw's memory of

<!-- Page 348 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
those
three days or so, when they have grown quite old together, as we
hope they may. And if you add memory of an intoxicated delirium of
love&mdash;of love that was on no account to be shown or declared or even
hinted at&mdash;and of a tiresome hitch or qualification, an unselfish
parent in full blow, you will have the record that is to remain in
the mind of Conrad Vereker.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>

<p class="subhead">HOW SALLY DIDN'T CONFESS ABOUT THE DOCTOR, AND JEREMIAH CAME TO
ST.&nbsp;SENNANS ONCE&nbsp;MORE</p>

<p>That evening Sally sat with her mother on the very uncomfortable
seat they affected on what was known as the Parade, a stone's throw
from the house for a good stone-thrower. It had a little platform of
pebbles to stand on, and tamarisks to tickle you from behind when
the wind was northerly. It was a corrugated and painful seat, and
had a strange power of finding out your tender vertebr&aelig; and
pulverising them, whatever your stature might be. It fell forward
when its occupants, goaded to madness, bore too hard on its front
bar, and convinced them they would do well, henceforward, to hold it
artificially in its place. But Rosalind and her daughter forgave it
all these defects&mdash;perhaps because they were really too lazy to
protest even against torture. It was the sea air. Anyhow, there they
sat that evening, waiting for Padlock's omnibus to come, bringing
Fenwick from the station. Just at the moment at which the story
overtakes them, Rosalind was looking wonderfully handsome in the
sunset light, and Sally was thinking to herself what a beautiful
mother she had; and how, when the after-glow dies, it will leave its
memory in the red gold that is somewhere in the rich brown her eyes
are resting on. Sally was fond of dwelling on her mother's beauty.
Perhaps doing so satisfied her personal vanity by deputy. She was
content with her own self, but had no admiration for it.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> a dear good mammy. Fancy your losing all the best time of
the morning indoors!"</p>

<p>"How the best time of the morning, chick?"</p>

<p>"Sitting with that old cat upstairs.... Well, I can't help it. She
<i>is</i> an old cat."</p>

<p>"You're a perverse little monkey, kitten; that's what <i>you</i> are!"
Rosalind laughed with an excuse&mdash;or caress, it may be&mdash;in her
laugh.

<!-- Page 350 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
"No," she continued, "we are much too hard on that old lady,
both of us. Do you know, to-day she was quite entertaining&mdash;told me
all about her own wedding-day, and how all the bridesmaids had the
mumps."</p>

<p>"Has she never told you that before?"</p>

<p>"Only once. Then she told me about the late-lamented, and what a
respect he had for her judgment, and how he referred to her at every
crisis. I didn't think her at all bad company."</p>

<p>"Because you're a darling. I suppose you had it all about how Prosy,
when he was a boy, wanted to study music, and how his pa said that
the turning-point in the career of youth lay in the choice of a
profession."</p>

<p>"Oh yes! And how his strong musical turn came from her side of the
family. In herself it was dormant. But her Aunt Sophia had never
once put her finger on a false note of the piano. This was confirmed
by the authority of her eminent uncle, Dr.&nbsp;Everett Gayler, himself
no mean musician."</p>

<p>"Poor Prosy! I know."</p>

<p>"And how musical faculty&mdash;amounting to genius&mdash;often remained
absolutely unsuspected owing to its professor having no inheritance.
But it would come out in the children. Then, and not till then,
tardy justice was done.... Well, I don't know exactly how she worked
it out, but she managed to suggest that she was Handel and Mozart in
abeyance. Her son's fair complexion clinched matters. It was the
true prototype of her own. A thoroughly musical complexion,
bespeaking German ancestry."</p>

<p>"Isn't that the omnibus?" says Sally. But, no, it isn't. She
continues: "I don't believe in musical complexions. Look at Julius
Bradshaw&mdash;dark, with high cheek-bones, and a thin olive hand with
blue veins in it. I say, mother...."</p>

<p>"What, chick?"</p>

<p>"He's changed his identity&mdash;Julius Bradshaw has. I can't believe he
was that spooney boy that used to come hankering after me at
church." And the amusement this memory makes hangs about Sally's
lips as the two sit on into a pause of silence.</p>

<p>The face of the mother does not catch the amusement, but remains
grave and thoughtful. She does not speak; but the handsome eyes that
rest so lovingly on the speaker are full of something from the
past&mdash;some record that it would be an utter bewilderment

<!-- Page 351 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
to Sally
to read&mdash;a bewilderment far beyond that crux of the moment which
maybe has struck her young mind for the first time&mdash;the old familiar
puzzle of the change that comes to all of us in our transition from
first to last experience of the strange phenomenon we call a friend.
Sally can't make it out&mdash;the way a silly lad, love-struck about her
indifferent self so short a while back, has become a totally altered
person, the husband of her schoolmate, an actual identity of life
and thought and feeling; he who was in those early days little more
than a suit of clothes and a new prayer-book.</p>

<p>But if that is so strange to Sally, how measurelessly stranger is
she herself to her mother beside her! And the man they are waiting
and watching for, who is somewhere between this and St.&nbsp;Egbert's
station in Padlock's venerable 'bus, what a crux is <i>he</i>, compared
now to that intoxicated young lover of two-and-twenty years ago, in
that lawn-tennis garden that has passed so utterly from his memory!
And a moment's doubt, "But&mdash;has it?" is caught and absorbed by what
seemed to Rosalind now an almost absurd fact&mdash;that, a week before,
he had been nothing but a <i>fidus Achates</i> of that other young man
provided to make up the lawn-tennis set, and that it was that other
young man at first, not he, that belonged to <i>her</i>. And he had
changed away so easily to&mdash;who was it? Jessie Nairn, to be sure&mdash;and
left the coast clear for his friend. Whatever now <i>was</i> his name? Oh
dear, what a fool was Rosalind! said she to herself, to have half
let slip that it was <i>he</i> that was Fenwick, and not Gerry at all.
All this compares itself with Sally's experience of Bradshaw's
metamorphosis, and her own seems the stranger.</p>

<p>Then a moment of sharp pain that she cannot talk to Sally of these
things, but must lead a secret life in her own silent heart. And
then she comes back into the living world, and finds Sally well on
with the development of another topic.</p>

<p>"Of course, poor dears! They've not played a note together since the
row. It's been nothing but Kensington Gardens or the Albert Hall.
But I'm afraid he's no better. If only he <i>could</i> be, it would make
all the difference."</p>

<p>"What's that, darling? <i>Who</i> could be...? Not your father?" For, as
often as not, Rosalind would speak of her husband as Sally's father.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 352 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Not Jeremiah&mdash;no. I was talking about Julius B. and his nervous
system. Wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it what?"</p>

<p>"Make all the difference? I mean that he could get his
violin-playing back. I told you about that letter?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;what letter?"</p>

<p>"From an agent in Paris. Rateau, I think, was the name. Had heard
Signor Carissimi had recovered his health completely, and was
playing. Hoped he might be honoured with his instructions to make
his arrangements in Paris, as he had done so four years ago. Wasn't
it aggravating?"</p>

<p>"Does it make any difference?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course it does, mother darling. The aggravation! Just think
now! Suppose he could rely on ten pounds a night, fancy that!"</p>

<p>"Suppose he could!... Yes, that would be nice." But there is a
preoccupation in her tone, and Sally wants sympathy to be drawn with
a vigorous outline.</p>

<p>"What's my maternal parent thinking about, as grave as a judge?
Jeremiah's all right, mammy darling! <i>He's</i> not killed in a railway
accident. Catch <i>him</i>!" This is part of a systematized relationship
between the two. Each always discredits the possibility of mishap to
the other. It might be described as chronic reciprocal Christian
Science.</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of Gerry." Which is true in a sense, as she does
not think of the Gerry her daughter knows. And the partial untruth
does not cross her mind&mdash;a tacit recognition of the powers of
change. "I was wool-gathering."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;what <i>was</i> she thinking of?" For some reason the third person
is thought more persuasive than the second.</p>

<p>"Thinking of her kitten." And this is true enough, as Rosalind is
really always thinking of Sally, more or less.</p>

<p>"We-ell, <i>I'm</i> all right. What's the matter with <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all that I know of, darling." But it does cross the
speaker's mind that the context of circumstances might make this an
opportunity for getting at some information she wants. For Sally has
remained perfectly inscrutable about Conrad Vereker, and Rosalind
has been asking herself whether it is possible that, after all,
there <i>is</i> nothing. She doesn't know how to set about

<!-- Page 353 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
it, though.
Perhaps the best thing would be to take a leaf out of Sally's own
book, and go straight to the bull's-eye.</p>

<p>"Do you really want to know what I was thinking of, Sallykin?" But
no sooner has she formulated the intention of asking a question, and
allowed the intention to creep into her voice than Sally knows all
about it.</p>

<p>"As if I don't know already. You mean me and Prosy."</p>

<p>"Of course. But how did you know?"</p>

<p>"Mammy <i>dear</i>! As if I was born yesterday! If you want people not to
know things, you mustn't have delicate inflexions of voice. I knew
you were going to catechize about Prosy the minute you got to 'did I
really want to know.'"</p>

<p>"But I'm not going to catechize, chick. Only when you ask me what
I'm thinking about, and really want to know, I tell you. I <i>was</i>
thinking about you and Conrad Vereker." For some mysterious reason
this mention of his name in full seems to mature the conversation,
and make clearer definition necessary.</p>

<p>Our own private opinion is that any one who closely observes human
communion will see that two-thirds of it runs on lines like the
foregoing. Very rarely indeed does a human creature say what it
means. Exhaustive definition, lucid statements, concise
terminology&mdash;even plain English&mdash;are foreign to its nature. The
congenial soil in which the fruit of Intelligence ripens is
Suggestion, and the wireless telegraphs of the mind are the means by
which it rejoices to communicate. Don't try to say what you
mean&mdash;because <i>you</i> can't. You are not clever enough. Try to mean
what you want to say, and leave the dictionary to take care of
itself.</p>

<p>This little bit of philosophizing of ours has just given Sally time,
pondering gravely with the eyebrows all at rest and lips at ease, to
deal with the developed position created by the mere substitution of
a name for a nickname.</p>

<p>"Ought there to be ... anything to think about?" Thus Sally; and her
mother sees, or thinks she sees, a little new colour in the girl's
cheeks. Or is it only the sunset? Then Rosalind says to herself that
perhaps she has made a mistake, had better have left it alone.
Perhaps. But it's done now. She is not one that goes back on her
resolutions. It is best not to be too tugging and solemn over it.
She speaks with a laugh.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 354 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"It's not my little daughter I'm afraid of, Sallykin. She's got the
key of the position. It's that dear good boy."</p>

<p>"He's not a boy. He's thirty-one next February. Only he's not got a
birthday, because it's not leap-year. Going by birthdays he's not
quite half-past seven."</p>

<p>"Then it won't do to go by birthdays. Even at thirty-one, though,
some boys are not old enough to know better. He's very inexperienced
in some things."</p>

<p>"A babe unborn&mdash;only he can write prescriptions. Only they don't do
you any good. ("Ungrateful child!"... "Well, they <i>don't</i>.") You
see, he hasn't any one to go to to ask about things except me. Of
course <i>I</i> can tell him, if you come to that!"</p>

<p>"There's his mother."</p>

<p>"His mother! That old dianthus! Oh, mammy darling, what different
sorts of mothers do crop up when you think of it!" And Sally is so
moved by this scientific marvel that she suddenly kisses her mother,
there out on the public parade with a gentleman in check trousers
and an eye-glass coming along!</p>

<p>"Why do you call the old lady a dianthus, chick? Really, the way you
treat that poor old body!..."</p>

<p>"Not when Prosy's there. I know my place.... We-ell, you know what a
dianthus's figure is like? When the tentacles are in, I mean."</p>

<p>But Rosalind tacitly condemns the analogy. Is she not herself a
mother, and bound to take part with her kind, however obese? "What
were you and the doctor talking about in the boat all that long time
yesterday?" she asks, skipping an interval which might easily have
contained a review of Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker inside-out like a sea-anemone.
Sally is quite equal to it.</p>

<p>"Resuscitation after drowning. Prosy says death is really due to
carbonic acid poisoning. Anybody would think it was choking, but
it's nothing of the sort. The arterial blood is insufficiently fed
with oxygen, and death ensues."</p>

<p>"How long did you talk about that?"</p>

<p>"Ever so long. Till I asked him what he should do if a visitor were
drowned and couldn't be brought to. Not at the hotel; down here. Me,
for instance."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He was jolly solemn over it, Prosy was. Said he should try his

<!-- Page 355 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
best, and as soon as he was sure it was no go, put an end to his own
existence. I said that would be wrong, and besides, he couldn't do
it. He said, oh yes, he could&mdash;he could inject air into a vein, and
lots of things. He went on a physiological tack, so I quoted
Hamlet."</p>

<p>"What did he make of Hamlet?"</p>

<p>"Said the researches of modern science all tended to prove that
extinction awaited us at death, and he would take his chance. He was
quite serious over it."</p>

<p>"And then you said?..."</p>

<p>"I said, suppose it turned out that modern science was tommy-rot,
wouldn't he feel like a fool when all was said and done? He admitted
that he might, in that case. But he would take his chance, he said.
And then we had a long argument, Prosy and I."</p>

<p>"Has he ever resuscitated a drowned person?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, two or three. But he says he should like a little more
practice, as it's a very interesting subject."</p>

<p>"You really are the most ridiculous little kitten there ever was!
Talking like the President of the Royal College of Surgeons! Not a
smile."</p>

<p>"We-ell, there's nothing in <i>that</i>." Slightly offended dignity on
Miss Sally's part. "I say, the 'bus is very late; it's striking
seven."</p>

<p>But just as St.&nbsp;Sennan ceases, and leaves the air clear for
listening, Rosalind exclaims, "Isn't that it?" And this time it is
it, and by ten minutes past seven Fenwick is in the arms of his
family, who congratulate him on a beautiful new suit of navy-blue
serge, in which he looks very handsome.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Often now when she looks back to those days can Rosalind see before
her the grave young face in the sundown, and hear the tale of Dr.
Conrad's materialism. And then she sees once more over the smooth
purple sea of the day before the little boat sculled by Vereker,
with Sally in the stern steering. And the white sails of the Grace
Darling of St.&nbsp;Sennans, that had taken a large party out at sixpence
each person three hours ago, and couldn't get back by herself for
want of wind, and had to be towed by a row-boat, whose oars sounded
rhythmically across the

mile of intervening water. She was doing
nothing to help, was Grace, but her sails flopped a little now and
again, just enough to show how glad she would have been to do so
with a little encouragement. Rosalind can see it all again quite
plain, and the little white creamy cloud that had taken pity on the
doctor sculling in the boat, and made a cool island of shadow,
coloured imperial purple on the sea, for him and Sally to float in,
and talk of how some unknown person, fool enough to get drowned,
should one day be recalled from the gate of Death.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>

<p class="subhead">HOW SALLY DIVED OFF THE BOAT, AND SHOCKED THE BEACH. OF THE
SENSITIVE DELICACY OF THE OCTOPUS. AND OF DR. EVERETT GAYLER'S
OPINIONS</p>

<p>Fenwick had been granted, or had appropriated, another week's
holiday, and the wine-trade was to lose some of his valuable
services during that time. Not all, because in these days you can do
so much by telegraph. Consequently the chimney-piece with the
rabbits made of shells on each side, and the model of the
Dreadnought&mdash;with real planks and a companion-ladder that went too
far down, and almost serviceable brass carronades ready for
action&mdash;and a sampler by Mercy Lobjoit (1763), showing David much
too small for the stitches he was composed of, and even Goliath not
big enough to have two lips&mdash;this chimney-piece soon become a
magazine of yellow telegrams, which blew away when the window and
door were open at the same time.</p>

<p>It was on the second of Fenwick's days on this visit that an unusual
storm of telegrams, as he came in to breakfast after an early dip in
the sea, confirmed the statement in the paper of the evening before
that W. and S.W. breezes might be expected later. "Wind freshening,"
was the phrase in which the forecast threw doubts on the permanency
of its recent references to a smooth Channel-passage. However, faith
had already been undermined by current testimony to light easterly
winds backing north, on the coast of Ireland. Sally was denouncing
meteorology as imposture when the returning bather produced the
effect recorded. It interrupted a question on his lips as he
entered, and postponed it until the telegram papers had all been
reinstated and the window closed, so that Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit might come in
with the hot rolls and eggs and not have anything blown away. Then
peace reigned and the question got asked.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do to-day?" said Sally, repeating it. "I

<!-- Page 358 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
know
what I'm going to do first. I'm going to swim round the buoy."</p>

<p>"My dear, they'll never put the machines down to-day." This was her
mother.</p>

<p>"They'll do it fast enough, if I tell 'em to. It's half the fun,
having it a little rough."</p>

<p>"Well, kitten, I suppose you'll go your own way; only I shall be
very glad when you're back in your machine. Coffee, Gerry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, coffee&mdash;in the big cup with the chip, and lots of milk. You're
a dangerous young monkey, Sarah; and I shall get old Benjamin's
boat, and hang about. And then you'll be happy, Rosey, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, I shan't! We shall have you getting capsized, too. (I put in
three lumps of sugar.... No, <i>not</i> little ones&mdash;<i>big</i> ones!) What a
thing it is to be connected with aquatic characters!"</p>

<p>"Never you mind the mother, Jeremiah. You get the boat. I should
like it to dive off."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll get Vereker, and we'll row out. The doctor's not
bad as an oarsman. Bradshaw doesn't make much of it. (Yes, thanks;
another egg. The brown one preferred; don't know why!) Yes, I'll get
Dr.&nbsp;Conrad, and you shall come and dive off."</p>

<p>All which was duly done, and Sally got into great disgrace by
scrambling up into the boat with the help of a looped rope hung over
the side, and was thereafter known to more than one decorous family
group frequenting the beach as that bold Miss Nightingale. But what
did Sally care what those stuffy people thought about her, with such
a set-off against their bad opinion as the glorious plunge down into
the depths, and the rushing sea-murmur in her ears, the only sound
in the strange green silence; and then the sudden magic of the
change back to the dazzling sun on the moving foam, and some human
voice that was speaking when she dived only just ending off? Surely,
after so long a plunge down, down, that voice should have passed on
to some new topic.</p>

<p>For that black and shining merpussy, during one deep dive into the
under-world of trackless waters, had had time to recollect an
appointment with a friend, and had settled in her mind that, as soon
as she was once more in upper air, she would mention

<!-- Page 359 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
it to the crew
of the boat she had dived from. She was long enough under for that.
Then up she came into the rise and fall and ripple overhead like a
sudden Loreley, and as soon as she could see where the boat had got
to, and was free of a long stem of floating weed she had caught up
in the foam, she found her voice. And in it, as it rang out in the
morning air, was a world of youth and life and hope from which care
was an outcast, flung to the winds and the waves.</p>

<p>"I say, Jeremiah, we've got to meet a friend of yours on the pier
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Time for you to come out of that water, Sarah." This name had
become nearly invariable on Fenwick's part. "Who's your friend?"</p>

<p>"A young lady for you! She's going to bring her dolly to be
electrified for a penny. She'll cry if we don't go; so will dolly."</p>

<p>"Then we <i>must</i> go, clearly. The doctor must come to see fair, or
dolly may get electrocuted, like me." Fenwick very rarely spoke of
his accident now; most likely would not have done so this time but
for a motive akin to his wife's nettle-grasping. He knew Sally would
think of it, and would not have her suppose he shirked speaking of
it.</p>

<p>But the laugh goes for a moment out of the face down there in the
water, and the pearls that glittered in the sun have vanished and
the eyes are grave beneath their brows. Only for a moment; then all
the Loreley is back in evidence again, and Sally is petitioning for
only one more plunge, and then she really will swim in. The crew
protests, but the Loreley has her way; her sort generally has.</p>

<p>"I always wonder," says Dr.&nbsp;Conrad, as they row to shore with
studied slowness&mdash;one must, to keep down to the pace of the swiftest
swimmer&mdash;"I always wonder whether they found that half-crown."
Probably he, too, only says this to accentuate the
not-necessarily-to-be-avoided character of the subject.</p>

<p>The reason Fenwick answered nothing, but remained thoughtfully
silent, was, as Dr.&nbsp;Vereker perceived after he had spoken, that the
half-crown was mere hearsay to him, and, as such, naturally enforced
speculation on the strange "B.C." period of which he knew nothing.
Time did but little to minimise the painful

<!-- Page 360 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
character of such
speculations, although it seemed to make them less and less
frequent. Vereker said no more, partly because he felt this, partly
because he was so engrossed with the Loreley. He dropped the
half-crown.</p>

<p>"You needn't row away yet," said the voice from the water. "The
machines are miles off. Look here, I'm going to swim under the boat
and come up on the other side!"</p>

<p>Said Fenwick: "You'll be drowned, Sarah, before you've done! Do
consider your mother a little!"</p>

<p>Said the Loreley: "All right! good-bye!" and disappeared. She was so
long under that it was quite a relief when she reappeared, well off
the boat's counter; for, of course, there was some way on the boat,
and Sally made none. The crew's eyes had been watching the wrong
water over the beam.</p>

<p>"Didn't I do that nicely?... 'Beautifully?' Yes, I should rather
think I did! Good-bye; I must go to my machine! They won't leave it
down any longer."</p>

<p>Off went the swimmer in the highest spirits, and landed with some
difficulty, so much had the south-west wind freshened; and the
machine started up the beach at a brisk canter to rejoin its many
unused companions on their higher level.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Conrad, with the exhilaration of the Loreley in his heart, was
to meet with a damper administered to him by his affectionate
parent, who had improved immensely in the sea air, and was getting
quite an appetite.</p>

<p>"There is nothing, my dear, that I detest more cordially than
interference," said she, after accepting, rather more easily than
usual, her son's apologies for coming in late to lunch, and also
being distinctly gracious to Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden about the
beefsteak-pudding. "Your father disapproved of it, and the whole of
my family. The words 'never meddle' were on their lips from morning
till night. Is it wonderful that I abstain from speaking, as I so
often do? Whatever I see, I am silent." And accordingly was for a
few illustrative seconds.</p>

<p>But her son, conceiving that the pause was one very common in cases
of incipient beefsteak-pudding, and really due to kidneys, made an
autopsy of the centre of Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden's masterpiece; but when he
had differentiated its contents and insulated kidneys beyond

<!-- Page 361 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
a
doubt, he stood exposed and reproved by the tone in which his mother
resumed:</p>

<p>"Not for me; I have oceans. I shall never eat what I have, and it
<i>is</i> so wasteful!... No, my dear. You ask, 'What is it, then?' But I
was going to tell you when you interrupted me." Here a pause for the
Universe to settle down to attention. "There is always so much
disturbance; but my meaning is plain. When I was a girl young women
were different.... I dare say it is all right. I do not wish to lay
myself open to ridicule for my old-fashioned opinions.... What <i>is</i>
it? I came back early, certainly, because I found the sun so tiring;
but surely, my dear, you cannot have failed to see that our front
window commands a full view of the bathing-machines. But I am
silent.... Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden does not understand making mustard. Hers
runs."</p>

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Conrad was not interested in the mustard. He <i>was</i> about the
cryptic attack on Sally's swimming and diving, which he felt to have
been dexterously conveyed in his parent's speech with scarcely a
word really to the point. There was no lack of skill in the Goody's
method. He flushed slightly, and made no immediate reply&mdash;even to a
superhumanly meek, "I know I shall be told I am wrong"&mdash;until after
he had complied with a requisition for a very little more&mdash;so small
a quantity as to seem somehow to reduce the lady's previous total
morally, though it added to it physically&mdash;and then he spoke, taking
the indictment for granted:</p>

<p>"I can't see what you find fault with. Not Miss Sally's
bathing-costume; nobody could!" Which was truth itself, for nothing
more elegant could have been found in the annals of bathing. "And if
she has a boat to dive off, somebody must row it. Besides, her
mother would object if...." But the doctor is impatient and
annoyed&mdash;a rare thing with him. He treats his beefsteak-pudding
coldly, causing his mother to say: "Then you can ring the bell."</p>

<p>However, she did not intend her text to be spoiled by irruptions of
Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden, so she waited until the frequent rice-pudding had
elapsed, and then resumed at an advantage:</p>

<p>"You were very snappish and peevish with me just now, Conrad,
without waiting to hear what I had to say. But I overlook it.

<!-- Page 362 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
I am
your mother. If you had waited, I should have told you that I have
no fault whatever to find with Miss Nightingale's bathing-dress. It
is, no doubt, strictly <i>en r&egrave;gle</i>. Nor can I say, in these days,
what I think of girls practising exercises that in <i>my</i> day were
thought unwomanly. All is changed now, and I am old-fashioned. But
this I do say, that had your father, or your great-uncle, Dr.
Everett Gayler, been told forty years ago that a time would come
when it would be thought no disgrace for an <i>English girl</i> to jump
off a boat with an <i>unmarried man</i> in it.... My dear, I am sure the
latter would have made one of those acrid and biting remarks for
which he was celebrated in his own circle, and which have even, I
believe, been repeated by Royalty. That is the only thing I have to
say. I say nothing of girls learning to swim and dive. I say nothing
of their bicycling. Possibly the young lady who passed the window
this morning with a gentleman <i>on the same bicycle</i> was properly
engaged to him; or his sister. Even about the practice of Sandow, or
Japanese wrestling, I have nothing to say. But if they are to dive
off boats in the open sea, in the face of all the beach, at least
let the boats be rowed by married men. That is all I ask. It is very
little."</p>

<p>What fools mothers sometimes are about their sons! They contrive
that these sons shall pass through youth to early manhood without a
suspicion that even mothers have human weaknesses. Then, all in a
moment, just when love has ridden triumphant into the citadel of the
boys' souls, they will sacrifice all&mdash;all they have won in a
lifetime&mdash;to indulge some petty spleen against the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i> that
threatens their dethronement. And there is no surer way of
undermining a son's loyalty than to suggest a want of delicate
feeling in the new Queen&mdash;nothing that can make him question the
past so effectually as to force him to hold his nostrils in a smell
of propriety, puffed into what seems to him a gale from heaven.</p>

<p>The contrast between the recent merpussy in the freshening seas, and
this, as it seemed to him, perfectly gratuitous intrusion of moral
carbolic acid, gave Dr.&nbsp;Conrad a sense of nausea, which his love for
his mother enjoined ignorance of. His mind cast about, not for ways
of excusing Sally&mdash;the idea!&mdash;but of whitewashing his mother,
without seeming to suggest that her own mind had anything Fescennine
about it. This is always the great

<!-- Page 363 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
difficulty skywardness has in
dealing with the moral scavenger. Are not the motives of purity
unimpeachable?</p>

<p>Goody Vereker, however, did not suspect herself of being a fool. On
the contrary, she felt highly satisfied with her speech, and may be
said to have hugged its peroration. Her son flushed slightly and bit
his lip, giving the old lady time for a corollary in a subdued and
chastened voice.</p>

<p>"Had I been asked&mdash;had you consulted me, my dear&mdash;I should certainly
have advised that Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick should have been accompanied by
another married man, certainly not by a young, single gentleman. The
man himself&mdash;I am referring to the owner of the boat&mdash;would have
done quite well, whether married or single. Boatmen are seldom
unmarried, though frequently tattooed with ladies' names when they
have been in the navy. You see something to laugh at, Conrad? In
your mother! But I am used to it." The doctor's smile was in memory
of two sun-browned arms that had pushed the boat off two hours ago.
One had Elinor and Kate on it, the other Bessie and a Union Jack.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, mother dear," said the doctor at last, "that if
Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick, who knew all about it, had seen anything outrageous
she would have spoken? She really only seemed anxious none of us
should get drowned."</p>

<p>"Very likely, my dear; she would be. You will, I am sure, do me this
justice, that I have throughout said, from the very beginning, that
Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick is a most excellent person, though I have sometimes
found her tiring."</p>

<p>"I am sorry she has tired you. You must always tell her, you know,
when you're tired, and then she'll come and fetch me." The doctor
resisted a temptation to ask, "From the very beginning of <i>what</i>?"
For the suggestion that materials for laceration were simmering was
without foundation; was, in fact, only an example of the speaker's
method. She followed it with another.</p>

<p>"It is so often the case with women who have passed a good deal of
time in India."</p>

<p>"Are women tiring when they have passed a good deal of time in
India?"</p>

<p>"My dear Conrad, <i>is it likely</i> I should talk such nonsense? You
know perfectly well what I mean." But the doctor merely awaited

<!-- Page 364 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
natural development, which came. "Mind, I do not say I <i>believe</i>
Mrs.&nbsp;Julius Bradshaw's story. But it would quite account for
it&mdash;fully!"</p>

<p>What would account for what? Heaven only knew! However, the speaker
was getting the bit in her teeth, and earth would know very soon.
Dr.&nbsp;Conrad was conscious at this moment of the sensation which had
once made Sally speak of his mamma as an Octopus. She threw out a
tentacle.</p>

<p>"And, of course, Mrs.&nbsp;Julius Bradshaw's story may be nothing but
idle talk. I am the last person to give credit to mere irresponsible
gossip. Let us hope it is ill founded."</p>

<p>Whereupon her son, who knew another tentacle would come and entangle
him if he slipped clear from this one, surrendered at discretion.
What <i>was</i> Mrs.&nbsp;Julius Bradshaw's story? A most uncandid way of
putting it, for the fact was he had heard it all from Sally in the
strictest confidence. So the insincerity was compulsory, in a sense.</p>

<p>The Octopus, who was by this time anchored in her knitting-chair and
awaiting her mixture&mdash;two tablespoonfuls after every meal&mdash;closed
her eyes to pursue the subject, but warmed to the chace visibly.</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell me, my dear Conrad, that you do <i>not</i> know
that it has been said&mdash;I vouch for nothing, remember&mdash;that Miss
Nightingale's mother was divorced from her father twenty years ago
in India?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it's any concern of yours or mine." But having said
this, he would have liked to recall it and substitute something
else. It was brusque, and he was not sure that it was a fair way of
stating the case, especially as this matter had been freely
discussed between them in the days of their first acquaintance with
Sally and her mother. Dr.&nbsp;Conrad felt mean for renegading from his
apparent admission at that time that the divorce was an affair they
might properly speculate about. Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker knew well that her son
would be hard on himself for the slightest unfairness, and forthwith
climbed up to a pinnacle of flawless rectitude, for his confusion.</p>

<p>"My dear, it is absolutely <i>none</i>. Am I saying that it is? People's
past lives are no affair of ours. Am I saying that they are?"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 365 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Well, no!"</p>

<p>"Very well, then, my dear, listen to what I do say, and do not
misrepresent me. What I say is this&mdash;(Are you sure Perkins has mixed
this medicine the same as the last? The taste's different)&mdash;Now
listen! What I say is, and I can repeat it any number of times, that
it is useless to expect sensitiveness on such points under such
circumstances. I am certain that your father, or your great-uncle,
Dr.&nbsp;Everett Gayler, would not have hesitated to endorse my opinion
that on the broad question of whether a girl should or should not
dive off a boat rowed by an unmarried man, no one is less likely to
form a correct judgment than a lady who was divorced from her
husband twenty years ago in India. But I say nothing against Mrs.
Fenwick. She is, so far as she is known to me, an excellent person,
and a good wife and mother. Now, my dear Conrad, I must rest, for I
fear I have talked too much."</p>

<p>Poor Prosy! All the edge of his joy of the morning was taken off.
But never mind! It would very soon be Sally herself again, and his
thirsty soul would be drinking deep draughts of her at the pier-end,
where the appointment was to be kept with the young lady and her
dolly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF AN INTERMITTENT CURRENT AT THE PIER-END, AND OF DOLLY'S
FORTITUDE. HOW FENWICK PUT HIS HEAD IN THE JAWS OF THE FUTURE
UNAWARES, AND PROSY DIDN'T COME. HOW SALLY AND HER STEP SAW PUNCH,
AND OF A THIN END OF A FATAL WEDGE. BUT ROSALIND SAW NO COMING&nbsp;CLOUD</p>

<p>An iron pier, with a sense of lattice structure about it, is not to
our old-fashioned minds nearly so fascinating as the wooden fabric
of our early memories at more than one seaside resort of our
boyhood. St.&nbsp;Sennan was of another school, or had become a convert
or pervert, if a Saint may be judged by his pier. For this was iron
or steel all through, barring the timber flooring whose planks were
a quarter of an inch apart, so that you could kneel down to see the
water through if you were too short to see over the advertisements a
sordid spirit of commercialism had blocked the side-railings with.
And if you were three or four, and there was nobody to hold you up
(because they were carrying baby), you did so kneel, and as like as
not got tar on your knees, and it wouldn't come off. Anyhow, Miss
Gwendolen Arkwright did, on her way to the appointment, and was
reproved therefore. On which she also reproved dolly in identical
terms, dolly having had a look through as well, though, indeed, she
can hardly be said to have knelt.</p>

<p>But to console us for the loss of the solid groins and bolted
timbers of our youth, and to make it palatable to us that the great
seas should follow each other for ever almost unopposed&mdash;instead of
being broken into floods of drenching foam visitors get wet-through
in&mdash;this unsubstantial-looking piece of cage-work expanded as soon
as it was well out in the open channel, and almost provided John
Bull with another "other island." And whereon the pier-company's
sordid commercialism had suggested the construction of a Chinese
joss-house, or Indian bungalow&mdash;our description is a random
one&mdash;that lent itself, or was lent by the company, at really an
almost nominal figure, for entertainments

<!-- Page 367 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
in the afternoon all
through the season. And round this structure were things desirable
by all mankind, and supposed to be desired by possessors of one
penny willing to part with it. For a penny-in-the-slot you could
learn your fate from a Sibyl, and repent of having spent your penny
on it. For another you could scent your pocket-handkerchief, and be
sorry you hadn't kept your penny for chocolate. For another you
could have the chocolate, and wish you had waited and taken a
cigarette. And for another you could take the cigarette, and realise
how ill-assorted are the flavours of chocolate and the best
Virginian tobacco.</p>

<p>But the pennyworth that seemed the worthiest of its penny was, no
doubt, the old-fashioned galvanic battery, which shocked you for a
sixth part of the smallest sum required by literature on first
publication. It had brass handles you took hold of, and brass basins
with unholy water in them that made you curl up, and anybody else
would do so too. And there was a bunch of wires to push in, and
agonize the victim who, from motives not easily understood, laid
himself open to torture. And it certainly said "whizzy-wizzy-wizz."
But Gwenny's description had been wrong in one point. For it was
yourself, the investigator, not the machine, that said "e-e-e-e!"</p>

<p>Now this machine was in charge of a young woman, who was also the
custodian of an invisible lady, who was to be seen for a penny each
person, children half-price. This appeared to be a contradiction in
terms, but public apathy accepted it without cavil. The taking of
this phenomenon's gate-money seemed to be almost a sinecure. Not so
the galvanic battery, which never disappointed any one. It might
disgust, or repel, those who had had no occasion to study this
branch of science, but it always acted up to its professions. Those
investigators who declined to have any more never could go away and
complain that they had not had enough. And no one had ever been
discontented with its baneful results when all the bundle of wires
was put in; indeed, the young person in charge said she had never
known any one to drain this cup of scientific experience to the
dregs. "Halfway in's enough for most," was her report of human
endurance. It was a spirited little machine, though old-fashioned.</p>

<p>Miss Arkwright and her dolly, accompanied, as we have hinted, by

<!-- Page 368 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
her Nurse Jane and baby, whose violent temper had condemned his
perambulator, and compelled his attendant to carry him&mdash;so she
said&mdash;were beforehand at the place and hour named. For security
against possible disappointment a fiction was resorted to that dolly
wouldn't cry if her mamma talked seriously to her, and it was
pointed out that Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick was coming, and Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick was
coming, and Miss Nightingale was coming, and Dr.&nbsp;Vereker was
coming&mdash;advantage being taken of an infant's love of vain
repetitions. But all these four events turned on dolly being good
and not crying, and the reflex action of this stipulation produced
goodness in dolly's mamma, with the effect that she didn't roar, as,
it seemed, she might otherwise have done.</p>

<p>Miss Gwendolen was, however, <i>that</i> impatient that no dramatic
subterfuge, however skilfully engineered, could be relied upon to
last. Fortunately, a young lady she recognised, and a gentleman whom
she did not personally know, but had seen on the beach, became
interested in baby, who took no notice of them, and hiccupped. But,
then, his eyes were too beady to have any human expression; perhaps
it was more this than a contempt for vapid compliment that made him
seem unsympathetic. The young lady, however, congratulated him on
his <i>personnel</i> and on the variety of his attainments; and this
interested Miss Gwendolen, who continued not to roar, and presently
volunteered a statement on her own account.</p>

<p>"My mummar zis a-comin', and Miss Ninedale zis a-comin', and Miss
Ninedale's mummar zis a-comin', and...." But Nurse Jane interposed,
on the ground that the lady knew already who was coming. She had no
reason for supposing this; but a general atmosphere of omniscience
among grown-up classes is morally desirable. It was, however,
limited to Clause 1. Miss Gwenny went on to the consideration of
Clause 2 without taking a division.</p>

<p>"To see dolly danvalised for a penny. My mummar says&mdash;see&mdash;sall&mdash;div
me a penny...."</p>

<p>"To galvanise dolly? How nice that will be!&mdash;Isn't she a dear little
thing, Paggy?&mdash;And we're just in time to see it. Now, that <i>is</i>
nice!" Observe L&aelig;titia's family name for her husband, born of
Cattley's.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Isn't that them coming, Tish?" Yes, it is. They are conscientiously
negotiating the turnstile at the pier-entrance, where one gets a
ticket that lets you on all day, and you lose it. Conscientiously,
because the pier-company often left its side-gate open, and relied
on public spirit to acquiesce in its turnstile without dispute.</p>

<p>But Bradshaw has the misfortune to fall in Nurse's good opinion. For
he asks who the important-looking party is, and is called to order.</p>

<p>"Sh-sh-iii-sh, love! Do take care! Gwenny's mamma&mdash;Mrs.&nbsp;Chesterfield
Arkwright. They've a house at Boxley Heath&mdash;friends of the Hugh
Jameses&mdash;those very high-flying people." This is not <i>&agrave; pleine
voix</i>, and a well-disciplined Nurse knows better than to hear it.</p>

<p>Miss Gwenny and dolly consent to accompany the lady and gentleman to
meet the party, the former undertaking to point out her mamma. "I
sail sow you wiss," she says; and then gives descriptive particulars
of the conduct of the galvanic battery, and forecasts its effect on
dolly.</p>

<p>"There's that dear little pet," says Sally; and resumes the
operation of spoiling the little pet on the spot. She isn't sorry to
tally the pet (whose phonetics we employ) "dest wunced round the p
on her soulders, only zis wunced." She is a little silent, is Sally,
and preoccupied&mdash;perhaps won't object to a romp to divert her
thoughts. Because she is afraid poor Prosy is in the tentacles of
the Octopus. She evidently is not in love with him; if she were she
would be feeling piqued at his not being in time to the appointment,
not fidgeting about his losing the fun. She made some parade, at any
rate, of her misgivings that poor Dr.&nbsp;Conrad had got hooked by his
Goody, and would be late. If she <i>was</i> piqued she concealed it.
Whichever it was, she found it congenial to "tally" Miss Arkwright
on her "soulders" twiced round the pier-end before the party arrived
within range of the battery. They meanwhile&mdash;that is to say,
Rosalind and her husband, L&aelig;titia and hers, with Sally and Gwenny's
mamma&mdash;lingered slowly along the pier listening to the experiences
of the latter, of men, women, and things among the right sort of
people.</p>

<p>"You really never know, and one cannot be too careful. So much

<!-- Page 370 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
turns on the sort of people you let your daughter get mixed up with.
I'm sure Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick will agree with me that Mrs.&nbsp;Hugh James was
right. You see, I've known her from a child, and a more unworldly
creature never breathed. But she asked me, and I could only say what
I did: 'Take the child at once to Paris and Ems and
Wiesbaden&mdash;anywhere for a change. Even a tradesman is better than a
professional man. In that case there may be money. But nowadays none
of the professions pay. And their connexions are most undesirable.'"</p>

<p>"Now <i>I</i> should call that a brig." Thus Bradshaw, pursuing the great
controversy. But Fenwick knows better, or thinks he does. She's a
brigantine, and there are sprits'ls on both masts, and only one
square sail on the foremast. He may be right, for anything we know.
Anyhow, her sheets are white in the sun, as she tacks down channel
against the west or south-west wind, which has freshened. And she is
a glorious sight as she comes in quite close to the pier-head, and
goes into stays&mdash;(is that right?)&mdash;and her great sails flap and
swing, and a person to whom caution is unknown, and who cares for
nothing in heaven or earth, sits unconcerned on a string underneath
her bowsprit, and gets wet through every time she plunges, doing
something nautical in connexion with her foresail overhead. And then
she leans over in the breeze, and the white sheets catch it full&mdash;so
near you can hear the boom click as it swings, and the rattle of the
cordage as it runs through the blocks&mdash;and then she gets her way on
her, and shoots off through a diamond-drench of broken seas, and we
who can borrow the coastguard's telescope can know that she is the
Mary of Penzance, but are none the wiser. And a man stripped to the
waist, who is washing radishes on the poop, continues washing
radishes unmoved, and ignores all things else.</p>

<p>"As far as the young man himself goes, I believe there is nothing to
be said. But the mother is quite unpresentable, perfectly
impossible. And the eldest sister is married to a Dissenting
clergyman&mdash;a very worthy man, no doubt, but not exactly. And the
girls are loud, etc., etc., etc." Miss Arkwright's mamma ripples on,
even as persons of condition ripple; and Tishy, whose views in this
direction have undergone expansion, manages to forget how she has
done the same herself&mdash;not long ago, neither!&mdash;and decides that the
woman is detestable.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 371 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Not so her daughter, who, with Sally as guardian and dolly as ward,
is awaiting the arrival of the party at the galvanic battery. She is
yearning for the great event; not for a promised land of jerks and
spasms for herself, but for her putative offspring. She encourages
the latter, telling her not to be pitened and kye. Dolly doesn't
seem apprehensive&mdash;shows great self-command, in fact.</p>

<p>But this detestable mother of a lovable daughter and an untempting
granddaughter is destined to become still more detestable in the
eyes of the Julius Bradshaws before she exhausts her topic. For as
the party draws near to the scene of scientific recreation&mdash;and
progress is slow, as she is deliberate as well as detestable; and,
of course, is the pace-maker&mdash;she climbs up to a higher platform, as
it were, for the contemplation of a lower deep. She assumes, for
purposes of temporary handling of the subject, the air of one too
far removed to know more about its details than the seismograph at
Greenwich knows about the earthquake in the Andes. A dim
contemplation of a thing afar&mdash;to be forgotten on the spot, after
record made.</p>

<p>"Luckily, it's not so bad in this case as&mdash;(Gwenny, you're tiring
Miss Nightingale. Come down!)&mdash;not so bad in this case as&mdash;(no, my
dear! you <i>must</i> wait for dolly to be galvanised. Come down at once,
and don't make conditions.)"</p>

<p>"But I love having her dearly&mdash;do let me keep her!" from Sally.</p>

<p>And from the human creature on her shoulders, "Miss Ninedale says
'<i>No!</i>'"</p>

<p>"Not so bad, you were saying, as...?" Thus Rosalind, to divert the
conversation from the child.</p>

<p>"Oh dear! What <i>was</i> I saying? That child! What plagues the little
things are!" The lady closes her eyes for two seconds behind a
horizontal gloved hand, a seclusion to recollect in; then continues:
"Oh yes, when it's a shopman. I dare say you've heard of that very
painful case&mdash;daughter of a well-known Greek Pr...."</p>

<p>But the speaker has tact enough to see her mistake from the
simultaneous loud speech it provokes. Every one seems to have
something vociferous to say, and all speak at once. Sally's
contribution

<!-- Page 372 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
is a suggestion that before dolly is put to the
torture we shall go into the downstairs place and see the gentleman
who's fishing catch a big grey mullet. It is adopted. Rosalind only
remains upstairs, and takes the opportunity to communicate the
Julius Bradshaw epic to Gwenny's mamma, who will now be more careful
than ever about the sort of people you pick up at the seaside and
drop. She puts these words by in her mind, for Gwenny's papa, later
on.</p>

<p>The gentleman who is to be seen catching the big grey mullet hadn't
caught it, so far&mdash;not when the party arrived on the strange
middle-deck of the pier the water reaches at high tide, and
persuades occasional molluscs to grow on the floor of, with promises
of a bath next month. The green reflected light from the endless
rise and fall of the waves Gwenny could see (without getting down)
through the floor-gaps, seemed to be urging the fisher-gentleman to
give it up, and pointing out that the grey mullet was down here, and
didn't mean to be caught. But he paid no attention, and only went on
doing all the things that fishers do. He ascribed the fishes'
reluctance to bite to the sort of sky, and not to common-sense on
their part. He tried the other side instead. He lost his worm, and
blamed him for going off the hook&mdash;which he would have done himself,
and he knew it! He believed, honestly, that a fish of fabulous
dimensions had thought seriously of biting, and would have bitten,
only you got in the light, or made a noise.</p>

<p>But there was no noise to speak of, really, except the clunk-clunk
of one or two moored rowboats down below, and the sh-r-r-r-r-p (if
that spells it) of their corrugated plank-sides, as they dipped and
dripped alternately. They were close to the bottom flight of stairs,
whose lowest step was left forlorn in the air, and had to be jumped
off when a real spring-tide came that knew its business.</p>

<p>Gwenny's remark, "Ze man is fissin'," seemed to point to an
incubation of an idea, familiar to maturer life, that fishing is
more truly a state than an action. But the addendum&mdash;that he didn't
cass any fiss&mdash;betrayed her inexperience. Maturity does not call
attention to ill-success; or, if it does, it lays it at the door of
the fish.</p>

<p>"What a jolly header one could have from here! No railings or

<!-- Page 373 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
anything. No&mdash;ducky! I won't put you down to look over the edge.
That's not a thing for little girls to do."</p>

<p>"You'd never get up again, Sarah. You'd have to swim ashore."</p>

<p>"One could swim round the steps, Jeremiah&mdash;at least, according to
the tide. It's slack water now."</p>

<p>"I wish, Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick&mdash;(so does Julius)&mdash;that you would make that
girl reasonable. She'll drown herself before she's done."</p>

<p>"I know she will, Mrs.&nbsp;Paganini. Sure and certain! Nobody can stop
her. But Vereker's going to bring her to."</p>

<p>"Where <i>is</i> the doctor, Tish? Didn't he say he was coming?" This was
Bradshaw. He usually says things to his wife, and leaves publication
to her.</p>

<p>"Of course he said he was coming. I wonder if anything's the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! It's his ma! The Goody's put an embargo on him, and kept
him at home. Poor Prosy!" Sally is vexed, too. But observe!&mdash;she
knows perfectly well that nothing but the Goody would have kept
Prosy from his appointment.</p>

<p>No one in particular, but every one more or less, supposes that now
we must go back for dolly to be galvanised, Tishy rather
reluctantly, for she does not share her husband's indifference about
what the detestable one above says on the subject of shopmen; Miss
Arkwright greedily, being reminded of a higher object in life than
mere grey mullet catching. She, however, ascribes her avidity to
dolly, calling on public credulity to believe that the latter has
spoken to that effect.</p>

<p>The arrangement of dolly in connexion with the two brass handles
offers difficulties, but a felicitous solution is discovered, for
not only will dolly remain in contact with both if her arms are
thrust inside them, but insomuch as her sleeves are stiff and
expansive, and require a perceptible pull to withdraw them, will
remain suspended in mid-air without further support, to enjoy the
rapture or endure the torture of the current, as may prove to be the
case. From this arises an advantage&mdash;namely, that her mamma will be
able to give her attention to the regulator, and shift the wire
bundle in and out, with a due regard to dolly's powers of endurance.</p>

<p>What little things the lives of the folk in this story have turned
on!

<!-- Page 374 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
Now, suppose Gwenny had never been allowed to take charge of
that regulator! However, this is anticipation.</p>

<p>When dolly had endured unmoved the worst that science could inflict,
nothing would satisfy Miss Gwenny but that every one else should
take hold in a circle, as on a previous occasion, and that she
should retain control of the regulator. The experiment was tried as
proposed, all present joining in it except Mrs.&nbsp;Arkwright, who
excused herself owing to the trouble of taking her gloves off.
Including nurse, there were six persons. However, as nurse couldn't
abide it, almost before it had begun to say whizzy-wizzy-wizz, this
number was reduced to five.</p>

<p>"Keep your eye on the kid, my dear," said Fenwick, addressing the
presiding young lady in his easy-going way; "don't let her put it on
all at once. Are you ready, Sarah? You ready, Mrs.&nbsp;Paganini? All
right&mdash;fire away!"</p>

<p>The young lady in charge kept a careful hand near Miss Gwenny's, who
was instructed or guided to increase the current gradually. Her
attitude was docile and misleading.</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;a little more&mdash;yes, a little more.... No, that's enough!...
Oh, what nonsense! that's nothing!... Oh, Sally, do let <i>go</i>!... Oh,
Tishy, what a goose you are! That's nothing.... E-ow! It's horrible.
<i>I</i> won't have any more of it." The chorus of exclamations, which
you may allot at choice, ended in laughter as the galvanised circle
broke up.</p>

<p>"Well, you are a lot of weak-kneed ... conductivities," said
Fenwick, feeling for the word. "That was nothing, as Sarah says."</p>

<p>"Look here," suggested Sally. "Me get between you two men, and
Gwenny stick it in full up." This was done, and Sally heroically
endured the "full up" current, which, as you doubtless are aware,
increases in viciousness as it has fewer and fewer victims. But she
wasn't sorry when it was over, for all that.</p>

<p>"You and I could take it full up," said Fenwick to Bradshaw, who
assented. But Paganini evidently didn't like it when it came to
three-quarters. Also, his wife said to him, "You'll spoil your
fingering, Julius."</p>

<p>Fenwick seemed to think them all over-sensitive. "I could stand that
by myself," said he, and took both handles.</p>

<p>But just at this moment a strange event happened. Somebody

<!-- Page 375 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
actually
applied to see the invisible lady. The eyes of the damsel in charge
were for one moment withdrawn from Miss Gwenny, who promptly seized
the opportunity to thrust in the regulator "full up."</p>

<p>Fenwick wasn't going to cry for mercy&mdash;not he! But his lips clenched
and his eyes glared, and his hands shook. "How can you be such a
<i>goose</i>, Jeremiah?" said Sally, who was standing close by the
battery, opposite to Gwenny. She thrust back the regulator, and put
an end to Fenwick's excruciations.</p>

<p>He said, "What did you do that for, Sarah? I could have stood it for
six months."</p>

<p>And Sally replied: "For shame, you wicked story! And after you'd
been electrocuted once, too!"</p>

<p>Fenwick burst into a great laugh, and exclaimed, "What on earth are
we all torturing ourselves for? Do let's go and get some tea." And
then carried Gwenny on his shoulders to the pier-entrance, where he
delivered her to her proprietors, and then they all sauntered
teawards, laughing and chatting.</p>

<p>Rosalind thought she had never seen Gerry in such health and
spirits. On their way up to the house they passed Punch, leaning
over the footlights to rejoice in his iniquity. Few persons of
healthy sympathies can pass Punch, and these only under the
strongest temptation, such as tea. Rosalind and L&aelig;titia and her
husband belonged to the latter class, but Fenwick and Sally elected
to see the immortal drama to a close. It lasted nearly through the
remainder of Fenwick's cigar, and then they came away, reluctant,
and wanting more of the same sort.</p>

<p>It was then that Sally's stepfather said a rather singular thing to
her&mdash;a thing she remembered afterwards, though she noticed it but
slightly at the time. She had said to him:</p>

<p>"Codling and Short will be quite rich men! What a lot of money
you've given them, Jeremiah!"</p>

<p>And he had replied: "Don't they deserve it?"</p>

<p>They had then walked on together up the road, he taking her arm in
his hand, as is the way nowadays, but saying nothing. Presently he
said, as he threw away the very last end of the cigar:</p>

<p>"It was the first lesson of my early boyhood in retributive
injustice. It's a poor heart that never rejoices at Punch."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 376 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
</div>

<p>It was the first time Sally had ever heard him speak of his boyhood
except as a thing he had forgotten.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Much, so much, of this chapter is made up of matter so trifling. Was
it worth recording? The chronicler might plead again as excuse his
temptation to linger over the pleasant hours it tells of, the utter
freedom of its actors from care, and his reluctance to record their
sequel. But a better apology for his prolixity and detail would be
found in the wonder felt by those actors when in after-life they
looked back and recalled them one by one; and the way each memory
linked itself, in a way unsuspected at the time, with an absolutely
unanticipated future. For even Rosalind, with all her knowledge of
the past, had no guess, for all her many misgivings and
apprehensions, of the way that things would go. Never had she been
freer from a sense of the shadow of a coming cloud than when she
looked out from the window while the tea she had just made was
mellowing, and saw her husband and daughter coming through the
little garden gate, linked together and in the best of spirits.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF THE REV. SAMUEL HERRICK AND A SUNSET. THE WEDGE'S PROGRESS. THE
BARON AGAIN, AND THE FLY-WHEEL. HOW FENWICK KNEW HIS NAME RIGHT, AND
ROSALIND DIDN'T. HOW SALLY AND HER MEDICAL ADVISER WERE NOT QUITE
WET THROUGH. HOW HE HAD MADE HER THE CONFIDANTE OF A LOVE-AFFAIR. OF
A GOOD OPENING IN SPECIALISM. MORE PROGRESS OF THE WEDGE. HOW GERRY
NEARLY MADE DINNER&nbsp;LATE</p>

<p>It was quite true, as Sally had surmised, that poor Prosy had been
entangled in the meshes of his Octopus. But Sally had also recorded
her conviction that he would turn up at tea. He did so, with
apologies. You see, he hadn't liked to come away while his mother
was asleep, in case she should ask for him when she woke up, and she
slept rather longer than usual.</p>

<p>"She may have been trying to do too much lately," said he, with a
beautiful faith in some mysterious activities practised by the Goody
unseen. Sally cultivated this faith also, to the best of her
ability, but she can hardly be said to have embraced it. The way in
which she and her mother lent themselves to it was, nevertheless,
edifying.</p>

<p>"You mustn't let her overdo it, doctor," said Rosalind, seriously
believing herself truthful. And Sally, encouraged by her evident
earnestness, added, "And make her take plenty of nourishment. That's
half the battle."</p>

<p>Whereupon L&aelig;titia, swept, as it were, into the vortex of a creed,
found it in her to say, "As long as she doesn't get low." It was not
vigorous, and lacked completion, but it reassured and enforced. By
the time the little performance was done every one in the room
believed that Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker did down the stairs, or scoured out
saucepans, or at least dusted. Even her son believed, so forcibly
was the unanimity. Perhaps there was a taint of the incredulous in
the minds of Fenwick and Bradshaw. But each thought the other was
heart-whole, and neither suspected himself of insincerity.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 378 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Sally was curious to know exactly what lines the Octopus had
operated on. That would do later, though. She would get Prosy by
himself, and make him tell her all about it. In the course of time
tea died a natural death. Fenwick indulged in a yawn and a great
shake, and remembered that he had no end of letters to answer. Mr.
and Mrs.&nbsp;Julius Bradshaw suddenly thought, for no reasonable reason,
that they ought to be getting back. But they didn't really go home.
They went for a walk landward; as it was so windy, instead&mdash;remember
that they were only in the third week of their honeymoon! Sally,
with Talleyrand-like diplomacy, achieved that she and Dr.&nbsp;Conrad
should go for another walk in another direction. The sea was getting
up and the glass was going down, and it would be fun to go and see
the waves break over the jetty. So said Sally, and Dr.&nbsp;Conrad
thought so too, unequivocally. They walked away in the big sea-wind,
fraught with a great inheritance from the Atlantic of cool warmth
and dry moisture. And if you don't know what that means, you know
mighty little of the ocean in question.</p>

<p>Rosalind watched them through the window, closed perforce, and saw
them disappear round the flagstaff with the south cone hoisted,
holding their heads on to all appearance. She said to herself:
"Foolish fellow, why can't he speak?" And her husband answered
either her thought or her words&mdash;though he could hardly have heard
them as he sat driving his pen furiously through letters&mdash;with:
"He'll have to confess up, Rosey, you'll see, before he goes."</p>

<p>She made no reply; but, feeling a bit tired, lay down to rest on the
sofa. And so powerful was the sea air, and the effect of a fair
allowance of exercise, that she fell into a doze in spite of the
intensely wakeful properties of Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit's horsehair sofa, which
only a corrugated person could stop on without a maintained effort,
so that sound sleep was impossible. She never became quite
unconscious of the scratching pen and the moaning wind; so, as she
did not sleep, yet did not want to wake, she remained hovering on
the borderland of dreams. One minute she thought she was thinking,
sanely, about Sally and her silent lover&mdash;always uppermost in her
thoughts&mdash;the next, she was alive to the absurdity of some
dream-thing one of them had suddenly

<!-- Page 379 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
changed to, unnoticed. Once,
half awake, she was beginning to consider, seriously, whether she
could not legitimately approach the Octopus on the subject, but only
to find, the moment after, that the Octopus (while remaining the
same) had become the chubby little English clergyman that had
married her to Gerry at Umballa, twenty years ago. Then she thought
she would wake, and took steps towards doing it; but, as ill-luck
would have it, she began to speak before she had achieved her
purpose. And the result was: "Do you remember the Reverend Samuel
Herrick, Gerry, at Umb&mdash;&mdash;Oh dear! I'm not awake.... I was talking
nonsense." Gerry laughed.</p>

<p>"Wake up, love!" said he. "Do your fine intelligence justice! What
was it you said? Reverend Samuel who?"</p>

<p>"I forget, darling. I was dreaming." Then, with a nettle-grasping
instinct, as one determined to flinch from nothing, "Reverend Samuel
Herrick. What did you think I said?"</p>

<p>"Reverend Samuel Herrick or Meyrick.... 'Not negotiable.' I don't
mean the Reverend Sam, whoever he is, but the payee whose account
I'm enriching." He folded the cheque he had been writing into its
letter and enveloped it. But he paused on the brink of its gummed
edge, looking over it at Rosalind, who was still engaged getting
quite awake. "I know the name well enough. He's some chap! I expect
you saw him in the 'Chronicle.'"</p>

<p>"Very likely, darling! He must be some chap, when you come to think
of it." She says this slightly, as a mere rounding-off speech. Then
goes behind her husband's chair and kisses him over his shoulder as
he directs the envelope.</p>

<p>"Marmaduke, Copestake, Dickinson, and Humphreys," says he, as he
writes the names. "Now I call that a firm-and-a-half. Old Broad
Street, E.C. <i>That's</i> all!&mdash;as far as <i>he</i> goes. Now, how about
Puckeridge, Limited?"</p>

<p>"Don't write any more, Gerry dear; you'll spoil your eyes. Come and
look at the sunset. Come along!" For a blood-red forecast of storm
in the west, surer than the surest human barometer, is blazing
through the window that cannot be opened for the blow, and turning
the shell-work rabbit and the story of Goliath into gold and jewels.
The sun is glancing through a rift in the cloud-bank, to say
good-night to the winds and seas, and wish

<!-- Page 380 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
them joy of the high old
time they mean to have in his absence, in the dark.</p>

<p>The lurid level rays that make an indescribable glory of Rosalind's
halo-growth of hair as Gerry sees it against the window, have no
ill-boding in them for either&mdash;no more, that is, than always has
belonged to a rough night closing over the sea, and will do so
always until the sea is ice again on a planet sick to death. As he
draws her arm round his neck and she his round her waist, and they
glance at each other in the flaming glow, there is no thought in
either of any ill impending for themselves.</p>

<p>"I wish Sarah were here to see you now, Rosey."</p>

<p>"So should I, love! Only she would see you too. And then she'd make
you vainer than you are already. All men are patches of Vanity. But
I forgive you." She kisses him slightly in confirmation. They
certainly were a wonderful sight, the two of them, a minute ago,
when the light was at its best. Yes!&mdash;they wish Sally had been
there, each on the other's account. It was difficult to say which of
the two had thought of Sally first. Both had this habit of
registering the <i>rapport</i> of everything to Sally as a first duty.</p>

<p>But a sunset glow, like this one, lasts, maybe, little longer than a
highest song-note may be sustained. It was to die. But Rosalind and
Gerry watched it out. His cheek was resting in the thick mass of
soft gold, just moving slightly to be well aware of it. The sun-ray
touched it, last of anything in the room, and died....</p>

<p>"What's that, dear love? <i>Why?</i>..." It was Rosalind that spoke.</p>

<p>"Nothing, dearest! No, nothing!... Indeed, nothing at all!"</p>

<p>"Gerry, what <i>was</i> it?"</p>

<p>"What was what, dear?"</p>

<p>"What made you leave off so suddenly?"</p>

<p>For the slightly intermittent movement of his cheek on her
hair&mdash;what hairy thing is there that does not love to be
stroked?&mdash;had stopped; and his hand that held hers had slipped from
it, and rested for a moment on his own forehead.</p>

<p>"It's gone now. It was a sort of recurrence. I haven't been having
them lately...."</p>

<p>"Come and sit down, love. There, now, don't fidget! What was it
about?" Does he look pale?&mdash;thinks Rosalind&mdash;or is it only the
vanished glow?</p>

<p>He is uncommunicative. Suppose they go out for a turn before dinner,
he suggests. They can walk down to the jetty, to meet Sarah and her
medical adviser. Soon said, soon settled. Ten minutes more, and they
are on their way to the fisher dwellings: experiencing
three-quarters of a gale, it appears, on the testimony of an Ancient
Mariner in a blue and white-striped woollen shirt, who knows about
things.</p>

<p>"That was <i>very</i> queer, that recurrence!" Thus Gerry, after leaving
the Ancient Mariner. "It was just as the little edge of the sun went
behind the bank. And what do you think my mind hooked it on to, of
all things in the world?" Rosalind couldn't guess, of course. "Why,
a big wheel I was trying to stop, that went slowly&mdash;slowly&mdash;like the
sun vanishing. And then just as the sun went it stopped."</p>

<p>"Was there anything else?" Entire concealment of alarm is all
Rosalind can attend to.</p>

<p>"No end of things, all mixed up together. One thing very funny. A
great big German chap.... I say, Rosalind!"</p>

<p>"What, Gerry darling?"</p>

<p>"Do you recollect, when we were in Switzerland, up at that last
high-up place, Seelisberg&mdash;Sonnenberg&mdash;do you remember the great fat
Baron that gave me those cigars, and sang?"</p>

<p>"Remember the Baron? Of course I do. Perfectly!" Rosalind contrived
a laugh. "Was he in it?" Perhaps this was rash. But then, not to say
it would have been cowardice, when it was on her tongue-tip. Let the
nettle be grasped.</p>

<p>"He was in it, singing and all. But the whole thing was mixed up and
queer. It all went, quite suddenly. And I should have lost him out
of it, as one loses a dream, if it hadn't been for seeing him in
Switzerland. It was something to hold on by. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I think I do. <i>I</i> had forgotten what I was dreaming about when I
woke on the sofa and talked that nonsense. But I held on to the
name, for all that."</p>

<p>"But then that wasn't a real person, the Reverend&mdash;what was
he?&mdash;Herrick or Derrick."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 382 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Rosalind passed the point by. "Gerry darling! I want you to do as I
tell you. Don't worry your head about it, but keep quiet. If memory
is coming back to you, it will come all the quicker for letting your
mind rest. Let it come gradually."</p>

<p>"I see what you mean. You think it was really a recollection of
B.C.?"</p>

<p>"I think so. Why should it not?"</p>

<p>"But it's all gone clean away again! And I can't remember anything
of it at all&mdash;and there was heaps!"</p>

<p>"Never mind! If it was real it will come back. Wait and be patient!"</p>

<p>Rosalind's mind laid down this rule for itself&mdash;to think and act
exactly as though there had been nothing to fear. Even if all the
past had been easy to face it would have shrunk from suggestions. So
thought she to herself, perhaps with a little excusable
self-deception. Otherwise the natural thing would have been to
repeat to him all the Baron's story.</p>

<p>No! She would not say a word, or give a hint. If it was all to come
back to him, it would come back. If not, she could not bring it
back; and she might, in the attempt to do so, merely plunge his
injured mind into more chaotic confusion. Much safer to do nothing!</p>

<p>But why this sudden stirring of his memory, just now of all times?
Had anything unusual happened lately? Naturally, the inquiry sent
her mind back, to yesterday first, then to the day before.
No!&mdash;there was nothing there. Then to generalities. Was it the sea
bathing?&mdash;the sea air? And then on a sudden she thought of the thing
nearest at hand, that she should have thought of at first. Yes!&mdash;she
would ask Dr.&nbsp;Conrad about <i>that</i>: Why hadn't she thought of that
before&mdash;that galvanic battery?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, despite her injunctions to her husband to wait and be
patient, his mind kept harking back on this curious recollection.
Luckily, so it seemed to her&mdash;at any rate for the present&mdash;he did
not seem to recall the Baron's recognition of himself, or to connect
it with this illusion or revival. He appeared to recollect the
Baron's personality, and his liberality with cigars, but little
else. If he was to be reminded of this, it must be after she had
talked over it with Vereker.</p>

<p>They struggled with the weather along the seaward face of the
little

<!-- Page 383 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
old fisher-town. The great wind was blowing the tar-laden
atmosphere of the nets and the all-pervading smell of tar landward;
and substituting flecks of driven foam, that it forced to follow
landward too, for all they tried to stop and rest. The population
was mostly employed getting the boats up as close to the houses as
practice permitted, and the capstans were all a-creak with the
strain; and one shrieked for a dab of lard, and got it, just as they
passed. The man with Bessie and the anchor on his arms&mdash;for it was
his&mdash;paused in his rotations with one elbow on his lever, and one
foot still behind the taut cable he was crossing. His free hand
saluted; and then, his position being defined, he was placed on a
moral equality with his superiors, and could converse. The
old-fashioned hat-touch, now dying out, is just as much a protest
against the way social order parts man from man as it is an
acknowledgment of its necessity.</p>

<p>The lover of Bessie and Elinor and Kate was disposed to ignore the
efforts of the wind. There might, he said, be a bit of sea on, come
two or three in the marn'n&mdash;at the full of the tide. The wind might
get up a bit, if it went round suth'ard. The wind was nothing in
itself&mdash;it was the direction it came from; it got a bad character
from imputed or vicarious vice. It would be a bit rough to get a
boat off&mdash;the lady might get a wetting.... At which point Rosalind
interrupted. Nothing was further from her thoughts, she said, than
navigation in any form. But had the speaker seen her daughter go
by&mdash;the young lady that swam? For Sally was famous. He hadn't,
himself, but maybe young Benjamin had. Who, taking leave to speak
from this, announced frankly that he <i>had</i> seen a young lady, in
company with her sweetheart, go by nigh an hour agone. The tattooed
one diluted her sweetheart down to "her gentleman" reluctantly. In
his land, and the one there would soon be for the freckled and
blue-eyed Benjamin, there was no such artificial nonsense. Perhaps
some sense of this showed itself in the way he resumed his work.
"Now, young Benjamin&mdash;a-action!" said he; and the two threw
themselves again against the pole of the mollified capstan.</p>

<p>If Rosalind fancied this little incident had put his previous
experience out of her husband's mind she was mistaken. He said,

<!-- Page 384 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
as
they passed on in the direction of the jetty, "I think I should like
to wind up capstans. It would suit me down to the ground." But then
became thoughtful; and, just as they were arriving at the jetty,
showed that his mind had run back by asking suddenly, "What was the
fat Baron's name?"</p>

<p>"Diedrich Kammerkreutz." Rosalind gave him her nearest recollection,
seeing nothing to be gained by doing otherwise. Any concealment,
too, the chances were, would make matters worse instead of better.</p>

<p>"It was Kreutzkammer, in my&mdash;dream or whatever you call it." They
stopped and looked at each other, and Rosalind replied, "It <i>was</i>
Kreutzkammer. Oh dear!" rather as one who had lost breath from some
kind of blow.</p>

<p>He saw her distress instantly, and was all alive to soothe it.
"Don't be frightened, darling love!" he cried, and then his great
good-humoured laugh broke into the tenderness of his speech, without
spoiling it. He was so like Gerry, the boy that rode away that day
in the dog-cart, when there was "only mamma for the girl."</p>

<p>"But when all's said and done," said she, harking back for a
reprieve, "perhaps you only recollected Sonnenberg in your dream
better than I did ... just now...." She hung fire of repeating the
name Herrick.</p>

<p>"<i>Ach zo</i>," he answered, teutonically for the moment, from
association with the Baron. "But suppose it all true, dearest, and
that I'm going to come to life again, what does it matter? It can't
alter <i>us</i>, that I can see. Could anything that you can imagine? I
should be Gerry for you, and you would be Rosey for me, to the end
of it." Her assent had a mere echo of hesitation. But he detected
it, and went on: "Unless, you mean, I remembered the hypothetical
wife?..."</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es!&mdash;partly."</p>

<p>"Well! I tell you honestly, Rosey darling, if I do, I shall keep her
to myself. A plaguing, intrusive female&mdash;to come between <i>us</i>. But
there's no such person!" At which they both laughed, remembering the
great original non-exister. But even here was a little thorn. For
Mrs.&nbsp;Harris brought back the name the Baron had known Gerry by. He
did not seem to have resumed it in his dream.</p>

<p>The jetty ran a little way out to sea. Thus phraseology in use. It
might have reconsidered itself, and said that the jetty had at some
very remote time run out to sea and stopped there. Ever since, the
sea had broken over it at high tides, and if you cared at all about
your clothes you wouldn't go to the end of it, if you were me.
Because the salt gets into them and spoils the dye. Besides, you
have to change everything.</p>

<p>There was a dry place at the end of the jetty, and along the edge of
the dry place were such things as cables go round and try hard to
draw, as we drew the teeth of our childhood with string. But they
fail always, although their pulls are never irresolute. On two of
these sat Sally and the doctor in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>Rosalind and her husband looked at each other and said, "No!" This
might have been rendered, "Matters are no forwarder." It connected
itself (without acknowledgment) with the distance apart of the two
cable-blocks. Never mind; let them alone!</p>

<p>"Are you going to sit there till the tide goes down?"</p>

<p>"Oh, is that you? We didn't see you coming."</p>

<p>"You'll have to look sharp, or you'll be wet through...."</p>

<p>"No, we <i>shan't</i>! You only have to wait a minute and get in
between...."</p>

<p>Easier said than done! A big wave, that was just in time to overhear
this conversation imperfectly, thought it would like to wet Sally
through, and leaped against the bulwark of the jetty. But it spent
itself in a huge torrential deluge while Sally waited a minute. A
friend followed it, but made a poor figure by comparison. Then Sally
got in between, followed by the doctor.... Well! they were really
not so <i>very</i> wet, after all! Sally was worst, as she was too
previous. She got implicated in the friend's last dying splash,
while Prosy got nearly scot-free. So said Sally to Fenwick as they
walked briskly ahead towards home, leaving the others to make their
own pace. Because it was a case of changing everything, and dinner
was always so early at St.&nbsp;Sennans.</p>

<p>"Let them go on in front. I want to talk to you, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad."
Rosalind, perhaps, thinks his attention won't wander if she takes a
firm tone; doesn't feel sure about it, otherwise. Maybe Sally is too
definitely in possession of the citadel to allow of an incursion
from

<!-- Page 386 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
without. She continues: "I have something to tell you. Don't
look frightened. It is nothing but what you have predicted yourself.
My husband's memory is coming back. I don't know whether I ought to
say I am afraid or I hope it is so...."</p>

<p>"But are you sure it is so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, listen! It has all happened since you and Sally left." And
then she narrated to the doctor, whose preoccupation had entirely
vanished, first the story of the recurrence, and Fenwick's
description of it in full; and then the incident of the Baron at
Sonnenberg, but less in detail. Then she went on, walking slower,
not to reach the house too soon. "Now, this is the thing that makes
me so sure it is recollection: just now, as we were coming to the
jetty, he asked me suddenly what was the Baron's name. I gave a
wrong version of it, and he corrected me." This does not meet an
assent.</p>

<p>"That was nothing. He had heard it at Sonnenberg. I think much more
of the story itself; the incident of the wheel and so on. Are you
quite sure you never repeated this German gentleman's story to Mr.
Fenwick?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure."</p>

<p>"H'm...!"</p>

<p>"So, you see, I want you to help me to think."</p>

<p>"May I talk to him about it?&mdash;speak openly to him?"</p>

<p>"Yes; to-morrow, not to-day. I want to hear what he says to-night.
He always talks a great deal when we're alone at the end of the day.
He will do so this time. But I want you to tell me about an idea I
have."</p>

<p>"What idea?"</p>

<p>"Did Sally tell you about the galvanic battery on the pier?" Dr.
Conrad stopped in his walk, and faced round towards his companion.
He shook out a low whistle&mdash;an <i>arpeggio</i> down. "Did she tell you?"
repeated Rosalind.</p>

<p>"Miss Sa...."</p>

<p>"Come, come, doctor! Don't be ridiculous. Say Sally!" The young
man's heart gave a responsive little jump, and then said to itself,
"But perhaps I'm only a family friend!" and climbed down. However,
on either count, "Sally" was nicer than "Miss Sally."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 387 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Sally told me about the electric entertainment at the pier-end. I'm
sorry I missed it. But if <i>that's</i> what's done it, Fenwick must try
it again."</p>

<p>"<i>Mustn't</i> try it again?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;<i>must</i> try it again. Why, do you think it bad for him to
remember?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think."</p>

<p>"My notion is that a man has a right to his own mind. Anyhow, one
has no right to keep him out of it."</p>

<p>"Oh no; besides, Gerry isn't out of it in this case. Not out of his
mind...."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that way. I meant excluded from participation in
himself ... you see?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I quite understand. Now listen, doctor. I want you to do me
a kindness. Say nothing, even to Sally, till I tell you. Say
<i>nothing</i>!"</p>

<p>"You may trust me." Rosalind feels no doubt on that point, the more
so that the little passage about Sally's name has landed her at some
haven of the doctor's confidence that neither knows the name of just
yet. He is not the first man that has felt a welcome in some
trifling word of a very special daughter's mother. But woe be to the
mother who is premature and spoils all! Poor Prosy is too far gone
to be a risky subject of experiment. But <i>he</i> won't say
anything&mdash;not he! "After all, you know," he continues, "it may all
turn out a false alarm. Or false hope, should I say?"</p>

<p>No answer. And he doesn't press for one. He is in a land of
pitfalls.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>"What have you and your medical adviser been talking about all the
while, there in mid-ocean?" Fenwick forgets the late event with
pleasure. Sally, with her hair threatening to come down in the wind,
is enough to stampede a troop of nightmares.</p>

<p>"Poor Prosy!" is all the answer that comes at present. Perhaps if
that uncontrolled black coil will be tractable she will concede more
anon. You can't get your hair back under your hat and walk quick and
talk, all at the same time.</p>

<p>"Poorer than usual, Sarah?" But really just at this corner it's

<!-- Page 388 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
as
much as you can do, if you have skirts, to get along at all; to say
nothing of the way such loose ends as you indulge in turn on you and
flagellate your face in the wind. Oh, the vicious energy of that
stray ribbon! Fancy having to use up one hand to hold that!</p>

<p>But a lull came when the corner was fairly turned, in the lee of a
home of many nets, where masses of foam-fleck had found a respite,
and leisure to collapse, a bubble at a time. You could see the
prism-scale each had to itself, each of the millions, if you looked
close enough. Collectively, their appearance was slovenly. A
chestnut-coloured man a year old, who looked as if he meant some day
to be a boatswain, was seated on a pavement that cannot have soothed
his unprotected flesh&mdash;flint pebbles can't, however round&mdash;and
enjoying the mysterious impalpable nature of this foam. However,
even for such hands as his&mdash;and Sally wanted to kiss them
badly&mdash;they couldn't stop. She got her voice, though, in the lull.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a little. I've found out all about Prosy."</p>

<p>"Found out about him?"</p>

<p>"I've made him talk about it. It's all about his ma and a young lady
he's in love with...." Fenwick's <i>ha!</i> or <i>h'm!</i> or both joined
together, was probably only meant to hand the speaker on, but the
tone made her suspicious. She asked him why he said that, imitating
it; on which he answered, "Why shouldn't he?" "Because," said Sally,
"if you fancy Prosy's in love with me, you're mistaken."</p>

<p>"Very good! Cut along, Sarah! You've made him talk about the young
lady he's in love with...?"</p>

<p>"Well, he as good as talked about her, anyhow! <i>I</i> understood quite
plain. He wants to marry her awfully, but he's afraid to say so to
her, because of his ma."</p>

<p>"Doesn't Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker like her?"</p>

<p>"Dotes upon her, he says. Ug-g-h! No, it isn't that. It's the
lugging the poor girl into his ma's sphere of influence. He's
conscious of his ma, but adores her. Only he's aware she's
overwhelming, and always gets her own roundabout way. I prefer
Tishy's dragon, if you ask <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>At that point Sally is quite unconscious of Fenwick's amused eyes
fixed on her, and his smile in ambush. She says the last words

<!-- Page 389 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
through a hairpin, while her hands take advantage of the lull to
make a good job of that rope of black hair. She will go on and tell
all the story; so Fenwick doesn't speak. Surprised at first by the
tale of Dr.&nbsp;Conrad's young lady, his ideas have by now fructified.
Sally continues:</p>

<p>"He's often told me he thought G.P.'s were better single, for their
wives' sakes&mdash;that sounds wrong, somehow!&mdash;but it isn't that. It's
his ma entirely. I suppose he's told you about the epileptiform
disorders?" No, he hadn't. "Well, now! Fancy Prosy not telling you
that! He's become quite an authority since those papers he had in
the 'Lancet,' and he's thinking of giving up general practice. Sir
Dioscorides Gayler's a cousin of his, you know, and would pass on
his practice to Prosy on easy terms. House in Seymour Street,
Portman Square. Great authority on epilepsy and epileptiform
disorders. Wants a successor who knows about 'em. Naturally. Wants
three thousand pounds. Naturally. Big fees! But he would make it
easy for Prosy."</p>

<p>"That would be all right; soon manage that." Fenwick speaks with the
confidence of one in a thriving trade. The deity of commerce,
security, can manage all things. Insecurity is atheism in the City.
"But then," he adds, "Vereker wouldn't marry, even with a house and
big-fee consultations, because he's afraid his mother would hector
over his wife. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"That's it! It's his Goody mother. I say, it <i>is</i> blowing!" It was,
and they had emerged from the shelter into the wind. No more talk!</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>As Fenwick, sea-blown and salted, resorted to the lodging-house
allowance of fresh water and soap, in a perfunctory and formal
preparation for dinner, his mind ran continually on Sally's
communication. As for the other young lady being valid, that he
dismissed as nonsense not worth consideration. Vereker had been
resorting to a furtive hint of a declaration, disguised as fiction.
It was a <i>fabula narrata de</i> Sally, <i>mutato nomine</i>. If she didn't
see through it, and respond in kind, it would show him how merely a
friend he was, and nothing more. "Perhaps he doesn't understand our
daughter's character," said Fenwick to Rosalind, when he had
repeated the conversation to her. "Of course

<!-- Page 390 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
he doesn't," she
replied. "No young man of his sort understands girls the least. The
other sort of young man understands the other sort of girls."</p>

<p>And then a passing wonderment had touched her mind, of how strange
it was that Sally should be one of her own sort, so very distinctly.
How about inheritance? She grew reflective and silent over it, and
then roused herself to wonder, illogically, why Gerry hadn't gone on
talking.</p>

<p>The reason was that as his mind dwelt happy and satisfied on the
good prospect Vereker would have if he could step into his cousin's
specialist practice as a consulting physician, with a reputation
already begun, his thoughts were caught with a strange jerk. What
and whence was a half-memory of some shadowy store of wealth that
was to make it the easiest thing in the world for him to finance the
new departure? It had nothing to do with the vast mysterious
possibilities of credit. It was a recollection of some resourceful
backing he was entitled to, somehow; and he was reminded by it of
his dream about the furniture&mdash;(we told you of that?)&mdash;but with a
reservation. When he woke from the sleep-dream of the furniture, he
in a short time could distinctly identify it as a dream, and was
convinced no such furniture had ever existed. He could not shake off
this waking dream, and it clogged his mind painfully, and made him
silent.</p>

<p>So much so that when Rosalind, soon completed for the
banqueting-board, looked into the adjoining room to see what
progress Gerry was making, and why he was silent, she only saw the
back of a powerful frame in its shirt-sleeves, and a pair of hands
holding on each side an unbrushed head. The elbows indispensable to
them rested on the window-bar.</p>

<p>"Look alive, Gerry darling!&mdash;you'll make dinner late.... Anything
wrong, dear love?" Sudden anxiety in her voice. "Is it another...?"
Another what? No need to define, exactly!</p>

<p>"A sort of one," Fenwick answers. "Not so bad as the last. Hardly
describable! Never mind."</p>

<p>He made no effort towards description, and his wife did not press
him for it. What good end could be gained by fidgeting him?</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 391 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
</div>

<p>But she knew now that her life would be weighted with an anxiety
hard to bear, until his hesitating return of memory should make its
decision of success or failure. A guarantee of the latter would have
been most to her liking, but how could she hope for that now?</p>

<p class="subhead">HOW A STONE THROWN DROVE THE WEDGE FURTHER YET. OF A TERRIBLE NIGHT
IN A BIG GALE, AND A DOOR THAT SLAMMED. THE WEDGE WELL&nbsp;IN</p>

<p>The speculative weather-wisdom of the tattooed capstan-driver was
confirmed when three in the morning came, and the full of the tide.
The wind must have gone round to the southward, or to some equally
stimulating quarter, to judge by the work it got through that night
in the way of roofs blown off and chimney-pots blown down; standing
crops laid flat and spoiled for reaping; trees too full of leaf to
bear such rough treatment compelled to tear up half their roots and
fall, or pay tribute to the gale in boughs snapped asunder in time
to spare their parent stem. All these results we landsmen could see
for ourselves next day, after the storm had died down, and when the
air was so delightful after it that we took walks in the country on
purpose to enjoy it. But for the mischief it did that night at sea,
from sportively carrying away the spars of ships, which they wanted
for their own use, or blowing a stray reefer from the
weather-earring, to sending a full crew to the depths below, or on
jagged rocks no message from the white foam above could warn the
look-out of in time&mdash;for the record of this we should have belated
intermittent newspaper paragraphs, ever so long after.</p>

<p>But the wind had not reached its ideal when, at the end of a
pleasant evening, Sally and her belongings decided that they must
just go down to the beach and see the waves before going to bed.
Wasn't there a moon? Well&mdash;yes, there was a moon, but you couldn't
see it. That made a difference, certainly, but not a conclusive one.
It wasn't a bad sort of a night, although it certainly was blowing,
and the waves would be grand seen close. So the party turned out to
go down to the beach. It included the Julius Bradshaws and Dr.
Conrad, who had looked in as usual. But

<!-- Page 393 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
the doctor found out that
it was past eleven, and, recalled by duty, returned to his Octopus.</p>

<p>The waves, seen close, would have been grand if you could have seen
them from the beach, or as much of it as they had left you to stand
on. But you really could only guess what was going on out in that
great dark world of deep thunder, beyond the successive rushes of
mad foam, each of which made up its mind to tear the coast up this
time; and then changed it and went back, but always took with it
stones enough for next attempt. And the indignant clamour of the
rushing shoals, dragged off to sea against their will, rose and fell
in the lulls of the thunder beyond. Sally wanted to quote Tennyson's
"Maud" about them, but she couldn't for the tremendous wind.</p>

<p>The propensity to throw stones into the water, whenever there are
stones and water, is always a strong one, even when the water is
black mountain ranges, foam-ridged Sierras coming on to crush us,
appalling us, even though we know they are sure to die in time.
Stones were thrown on this occasion by Sally and her stepfather, who
was credulous enough to suppose that his pebbles passed the undertow
and reached the sea itself. Sally was prevented by the elements from
misusing an adjective; for she wanted to say that the effect of a
stone thrown into such a sea was merely "hom&oelig;opathic," and
abstained because her remark would have been unheard.</p>

<p>Fenwick wanted to say that it was like the way a man dies and
vanishes into the great unknown. He, too, refrained from this, but
only partly for the same reason. Its want of novelty made another.</p>

<p>All the others soon wanted to say it was time to go home to bed, and
tried to say it. But practice seemed easier, and they all turned to
go, followed by Fenwick and Sally, cheerfully discussing the point
of whether Sally could have swum out into that sea or not. Sally
wanted to know what was to prevent her. Obvious enough, one would
have said!</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>But Rosalind noticed one thing that was a pleasure to her. The
moment Sally came in, her husband's dream-afflictions went out. Had
he ever spoken of one in her presence? She could recall no instance.
This evening the return to absolute cheerfulness

<!-- Page 394 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
dated from the
reappearance of Sally after she had changed everything, and made her
hair hold up. It lasted through fried soles and a huge fowl&mdash;done
enough this time&mdash;and a bread-and-butter pudding impaired by too
many raisins. Through the long end of a game of chess begun by Sally
and Dr.&nbsp;Conrad the evening before, and two rubbers of whist, in
which everybody else had all the good cards in their hands, as is
the case in that game. And through the visit to Neptune above
recorded.</p>

<p>But when, after half-an-hour's chat over the day's events with
Rosalind, midnight and an extinguished candle left Fenwick to
himself and his pillow in the little room next hers with no door
between, which Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit's resources dictated, there came back to
him first a recollection of his suppressed commonplace about the
stone that had vanished for ever in the world of waters; then a hazy
memory of the same thing having happened before and the same remark
having been made by himself; then a sudden jerk of surprise, when,
just as he was thinking of sleep, he was able to answer a question
Space asked him spontaneously about where this happened, with what
would have been, had he been quite awake, words spoken aloud to
himself. "That time at Niagara, of course!" And this jerk of
surprise left him wide-awake, struggling with an army of revived
memories that had come on him suddenly.</p>

<p>He was so thoroughly waked by them that a difficulty he always had
of remaining in bed when not asleep dictated a relighted candle and
a dressing-gown and slippers. It was akin to his aversion to
over-comfortable chairs; though he acknowledged beds as proper
implements of sleep, sleep being granted. And sleep seemed now so
completely out of the question, even if there had been no roaring of
the gale and no constant thunder of the seas on the beach below,
that Fenwick surrendered at discretion, and gave himself up a
helpless prisoner in the grasp of his own past.</p>

<p>Not of the whole of it. But of as much as he could face here and
now. Another mind that could have commanded some strange insight
into the whole of this past, and his power or powerlessness to look
it in the face, might have striven to avert its revival. That blow
might have been too overwhelming. But there was enough, as we shall
see, in the recollection that came back

<!-- Page 395 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
of the decade before his
return to England, to make his breath catch and a shudder run
through his strong frame as he pressed his palms hard on his
eyelids, just as though by so doing he could shut it out.</p>

<p>Thank God Rosey was asleep, or would be soon. He would have time to
think how he could tell the story he could not be silent
about&mdash;that, he felt, might be impossible&mdash;and yet keep back one
ominous portentous fact that had come to him, as a motive force in
his former life, without the details of his early history that
belonged to it. That fact Rosey must never know, even if ...
well!&mdash;so many things turned on it. All he could see now&mdash;taken by
surprise as he was&mdash;was that, come what might, that fact should
always be kept from <i>her</i>. But as to concealing from her his strange
experience altogether, that was hardly to be thought of. He would
conceal it while he could, though, provisionally.</p>

<p>One o'clock by his watch on the dressing-table under the candle. St.
Sennans must have struck unheard. No wonder&mdash;in this wind! Surely it
had rather increased, if anything. Fenwick paced with noiseless care
about the little room; he could not be still. The sustained monotone
of wind and sea was only crossed now and then by a sound of fall or
breakage, to chronicle some little piece of mischief achieved by the
former on land, and raise the latter's hopes of some such success in
its turn before the night should end....</p>

<p>Two o'clock by the dressing-table watch, and still the noiseless
slippered feet of the sleepless man came and went. Little fear of
any one else hearing him! For the wind seemed to have got up the bit
that was predicted of it, and had certainly gone round to the
suth'ard. If any sleeper could cling to unconsciousness through the
rattle of the windows and the intermittent banging of a spectral
door that defied identification&mdash;the door that always bangs in
storms everywhere&mdash;the mere movement of a cautious foot would have
no effect. If unable to sleep for the wind, none would be alive to
it. It would be lost in the storm....</p>

<p>Three o'clock! Did you, who read this, ever watch through a night
with something on your mind you are to be forced to speak of in the
morning&mdash;a compulsion awaiting you as a lion awaiting the <i>d&eacute;but</i> of
a reluctant martyr in the arena of the Coliseum? Did

<!-- Page 396 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
you, so
watching, feel&mdash;not the tedium&mdash;but the maddening speed of the
hours, the cruelty of the striking clocks? Were you conscious of a
grateful reliance on your bedroom door, still closed between you and
<i>your</i> lion, as the gate that the eager eyes of Rome were fixed on
was still a respite from <i>his</i>? Fenwick was; keenly conscious. And
when on a sudden he heard with a start that a furtive hand was on
the old-fashioned door-latch, he, knowing it could be none other
than Rosalind, sleepless in the storm, felt that the lion had stolen
a march on him, and that he must make up his mind sharp whether he
would go for complete confidence or partial reserve. Certainly the
latter, of necessity, said Alacrity. There could be no doubt of it,
on her account&mdash;for the present, at any rate.</p>

<p>For he had recollected, look you, that at the time of that
stone-throw into the rapids above Niagara he was a married man
somehow separated from his wife. And the way that he knew this was
that he could remember plainly that the reason he did not make an
offer of marriage, there by the great torrent that was rushing to
the Falls, to a French girl (whose name he got clearly) was that he
did not know if his wife was dead or living. He did not know it now.
The oddity of it was that, though he remembered clearly this
incident hinging on the fact that he was then a married man, he
could remember neither the wife he had married nor anything
connected with her. He strove hard against this partial insight into
his past, which seemed to him stranger than complete oblivion. But
he soon convinced himself that a slight hazy vision he conjured up
of a wedding years and years ago was only a reflex image&mdash;an
automatic reaction&mdash;from his recent marriage. For did not the wraith
of his present wife quietly take its place before the altar where by
rights he should have been able to recall her predecessor? It was
all confusion; no doubt of it.</p>

<p>But his mind had travelled quickly too; for when Rosalind looked in
at his door he knew what he had to say, for her sake.</p>

<p>"Gerry darling, have you never been to bed?"</p>

<p>"For a bit, dearest. Then I found I couldn't sleep, and got up."</p>

<p>"Isn't it awful, the noise? One hears it so in this house.... Well,

<!-- Page 397 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
I suppose it's the same in any house that looks straight over the
sea."</p>

<p>"Haven't you slept?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, a little. But then it woke me. Then I thought I heard you
moving."</p>

<p>"So I was. Now, suppose we both go to bed, and try to sleep. I shall
have to, because of my candle. Is that all you've got left?"</p>

<p>"That's all, and it's guttering. And the paper will catch directly."
She blew it out to avoid this, and added: "Stop a minute and I'll
take the paper off, and make it do for a bit."</p>

<p>"You can have mine. Leave me yours." For Fenwick's was, even now,
after burning so long, the better candle-end of the two. He took it
out of the socket, and slipped its paper roll off, an economy
suggested by the condition of its fellow.</p>

<p>But as he did so his own light flashed full on his face, and
Rosalind saw a look on it that scarcely belonged to mere
sleeplessness like her own&mdash;unrest that comes to most of us when the
elements are restless.</p>

<p>"Gerry, you've been worrying. You know you have, dear. Speak the
truth! You've been trying to recollect things."</p>

<p>"I had nobody here to prevent me, you see." He made no denial; in
fact, thought admission of baffled effort was his safest course. "I
get worried and fidgeted by chaotic ideas when you're not here. But
it's nothing." Rosalind did not agree to this at all.</p>

<p>"I wish Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit could have put us both in one room," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>we</i> didn't see our way, you know," he replied, referring to
past councils on sleeping arrangements. "It's only for a week, after
all."</p>

<p>"Yes, darling; but a week's a week, and I can't have you worried to
death." She made him lie down again, and sat by him, holding his
hand. So unnerved was he by his glance back into his past, so long
unknown to him, and so sweet was the comfort of her presence and the
touch of her living hand after all those hours of perturbation
alone, that Fenwick made no protest against her remaining beside
him. But a passiveness that would have belonged to an invalid or a
sluggish temperament seemed unlike the

<!-- Page 398 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
strong man Rosalind knew him
for, and she guessed from it that there was more behind. Still, she
said nothing, and sat on with his hand grasping hers and finding in
it his refuge from himself. To her its warm pressure was a sure sign
that his memory had not penetrated the darkness of his earlier time.
If God willed, it might never do so. Meanwhile, what was there for
it but patience?</p>

<p>As she sat there listening to the roaring of the gale outside, and
watching with satisfaction the evident coming of sleep, she said to
herself that it might easily be that some new thing had come back to
him which he would be unwilling she should know about, at least
until his own mind was clearer. He might speak with less reserve to
Vereker. She would give the doctor leave to talk to him to-morrow.
Fear of what she would hear may have influenced her in this.</p>

<p>So when, sooner than she had expected, she caught the sound of the
first breath of indisputable sleep, she rose and slipped away
quietly, and as she lay down again to rest again asked herself the
question: Was it the galvanism that had done it?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>

<p class="subhead">HOW FENWICK AND VEREKER WENT FOR A WALK, AND MORE MEMORIES CAME
BACK. HOW FENWICK WAS A MILLIONAIRE, OR THEREABOUTS. OF A CLUE THAT
KILLED ITSELF. HARRISSON'S AFFAIR NOW! BOTHER THE MILLIONS! IS NOT
LOVE BETTER THAN MONEY? ONLY FENWICK'S NAME WASN'T HARRISSON NEITHER</p>

<p>"We thought it best to let you have your sleep out, dear. Sally
agreed. No, leave the pot alone. Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit will make some fresh
coffee."</p>

<p>"Who's the other cup?"</p>

<p>"Vereker. He came in to breakfast; to see if we were blown away."</p>

<p>"I see. Of course. Where are they now?"</p>

<p>"They?... oh, him and Sally! They said they'd go and see if Tishy
and her husband were blown away."</p>

<p>"Well, I have had my sleep out with a vengeance. It's a quarter to
ten."</p>

<p>"Never mind, darling. So much the better. Let's have a look at
you...." And the little self-explanatory colloquy ends with Rosalind
kissing her husband and examining him with anxious eyes. She sees a
face less haggard than the one she saw last night, for is it not
daylight and has not the wind fallen to a mere cheerful breeze you
can quite stand upright in, leaning slightly seawards? And are not
the voices and the footsteps of a new day outside, and the swift
exchanges of sunlight and cloud-shadow that are chasing each other
off the British Channel? And has not a native of eighty years of age
(which he ignores) just opened the street door on his own
responsibility and shouted along the passage that pra'ans are large
this morning? He is more an institution than a man, and is freely
spoken of as "The Shrimps." A flavour of a Triton who has got too
dry on the beach comes in with the sea air, and also a sense of
prawns, emptied from a wooden measure they have been honourably
shaken

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
down into, falling on a dish held out to receive them by an
ambassador of four, named by Sally little Miss Lobjoit, the youngest
of her race.</p>

<p>But for all that the rising life of the hours and the subsiding gale
may do to chase away the memory of the oppressions of the night from
one who was defenceless in its solitude, Rosalind can see how much
they leave behind. Her husband may do his best to make light of
it&mdash;to laugh it off as nothing but the common bad night we all know
so well; may make the most of the noises of the storm, and that
abominable banging door; but he will not conceal from her the effort
that it costs him to do so. Besides, had he not admitted, in the
night, that he "got worried and fidgeted by chaotic ideas"? What
were these ideas? How far had he penetrated into his own past? She
was not sorry for the few words she had had time to exchange with
Dr.&nbsp;Conrad while Sally went to seek her hat. She had renewed and
confirmed her permission to him to speak to her husband freely about
himself.</p>

<p>"Are Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.&nbsp;Paganini gone to sea?" This is said as Fenwick
opens negotiations rather mechanically with the fresh coffee Mrs.
Lobjoit has produced, and as that lady constructs for removal a
conglomerate of plates and effete eggs.</p>

<p>"Gone to sea, Gerry? Not very likely. What's the meaning of that?
Explain."</p>

<p>"Why, Sally and her doctor are staring out at the offing...."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"And didn't you say they had gone to find out if they were blown
away?"</p>

<p>"I supposed they changed their minds." Rosalind talks absently, as
if they didn't matter. All her thoughts are on her husband. But she
doesn't fancy catechizing him about his experiences in the night,
neither. She had better let him alone, and wait new oblivion or a
healthy revival.</p>

<p>He is also <i>distrait</i>, and when he spoke of Sally and the doctor he
had shown no interest in his own words. His eyes do not kindle at
hers in his old way, and might be seeing nothing, for all there is
in them to tell of it. He makes very short work of a cup of coffee,
and a mere pretence of anything else; and then, suddenly rousing
himself with a shake, says this won't do, and he must go out and get
a blow. All right, says Rosalind, and he'd better

<!-- Page 401 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
get Dr.&nbsp;Conrad,
and make him go for a walk. Only they are not to fall over the
cliff.</p>

<p>"Fall over the cliff!" repeats Fenwick. He laughs, and she is glad
at the sound. "You couldn't fall over the cliff against such a wind
as this. I defy any one to." He kisses her and goes out, and she
hears him singing, as he hunts for a stick that has vanished, an old
French song:</p>

<p class="song">
"Aupr&egrave;s de ma blond-e<br />
Comme c'est bon&mdash;c'est bon&mdash;c'est bon...."
</p>

<p>Only, when he has found the stick and his hat, he does not go at
once, but comes back, and says, as he kisses her again: "Don't
fidget about me, darling; I'm all right." Which must have been
entirely brain-wave or thought-reading, as Rosalind had said never a
word of her anxiety, so far.</p>

<p>Fenwick walked away briskly towards the flagstaff where Sally and
Vereker had been looking out to sea. In the dazzling sunshine&mdash;all
the more dazzling for the suddenness of its come and go&mdash;and the
intoxicating rush of well-washed air that each of those crested
waves out yonder knew so much about&mdash;and they were all of a
tale&mdash;and such a companion in the enjoyment of it as that white
sea-bird afloat against the blue gap of sky or purple underworld of
cloud, what could he do other than cast away the thoughts the night
had left, the cares, whatever they were, that the revival of memory
had brought back?</p>

<p>If he could not succeed altogether in putting them aside, at least
he could see his way to bearing them better, with a kiss of his wife
still on his face, and all St.&nbsp;Sennans about him in the sunshine,
and Sally to come. However, before he reached the flagstaff he met
the doctor, and heard that Miss Sally had actually gone down to the
machines to see if Gabriel wouldn't put one down near the water, so
that she could run a little way. She was certain she could swim in
that sea if she could once get through what she called the
selvage-wave. If Gabriel wouldn't, she should take her things up to
the house and put them on and walk down to the sea in a cloak. It
was quite ridiculous, said the merpussy, people making such a fuss
about a few waves. What was the world coming to?</p>

<p>"She'll be all safe," was Fenwick's comment when he heard this.

<!-- Page 402 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
"They won't let her go in, at the machines. They won't let her leave
the Turkey-twill knickers and the short skirt. She always leaves
them there to dry. <i>She's</i> all right. Let's take a turn across the
field; it's too windy for the cliff."</p>

<p>"You had a bad night, Fenwick."</p>

<p>"All of us had. About three in the morning I thought the house would
blow down. And there was a door banged, etc...."</p>

<p>"You had a worse night than the rest of us. Look at me straight in
the face. No, I wasn't going to say show me your tongue." They had
stopped a moment at the top of what was known as The Steps&mdash;<i>par
excellence</i>&mdash;which was the shortest cut up to the field-path. Dr.
Conrad looks a second or so, and then goes on: "I thought so. You've
got black lines under your eyes, and you're evidently conscious of
the lids. I expect you've got a pain in them, one in each, tied
together by a string across here." That is to say, from eyebrow to
eyebrow, as illustrated fingerwise.</p>

<p>Fenwick wasn't prepared to deny it evidently. He drew his own
fingers across his forehead, as though to feel if the pain were
really there. It confirmed a suspicion he couldn't have sworn to.</p>

<p>"Yes; I suppose I did have a worse night than the rest of you. At
least, I hope so, for your sakes." His manner might have seemed to
warrant immediate speculation or inquiry about the cause of his
sleeplessness, but Vereker walked on beside him in silence. The way
was along a short, frustrated street that led to the field-pathway
that was grass-grown, more or less, all but the heaps of flints that
were one day to make a new top-dressing, but had been forgotten by
the local board, and the premature curb-stones whose anticipations
about traffic had never been fulfilled. The little detached houses
on either side were unselfish little houses, that only wanted to be
useful and afford shelter to the wanderer, or provide a refuge for
old age. All made use, on placards, of the cautious expression
"Apartments"; while some flung all reserve to the winds and said
also they were "To let" outright. The least satisfactory one of the
lot was almost invisible owing to its egotism, but distinguishable
from afar because the cross-board on a standard that had been placed
in the garden-front had fallen forward over the palings like Punch's
gallows. It

<!-- Page 403 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
didn't much matter, because the placard attached was
dissolving off in the rains, and hanging down so low that a goat was
eating it with relish, standing against the parapet of the
garden-fence.</p>

<p>They reached the point at which Albion Villas had been thwarted by a
hedge, rich in unripe sloes and green abortive blackberries, in
their attempt to get across a stubble-field to the new town, and
passed in instalments through its turnstile, or kissing-gate.
Neither spoke, except that Fenwick said, "Look at the goat," until,
after they had turned on to the chalk pathway, nearly dry in the
warm sun and wind, he added a question:</p>

<p>"Did you ever taste a sloe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, once."</p>

<p>"That is what every one says if you ask him if he ever tasted a
sloe. Nobody ever does it again."</p>

<p>"But they make sloe-gin of them?"</p>

<p>"That, my dear Vereker, is what everybody always says next. Sally
told me they did, and she's right. They console themselves for the
taste of the sloe by an imaginary <i>liqueur</i> like <i>maraschino</i>. But
that's because they never tasted sloe-gin."</p>

<p>Vereker thinks he may conclude that Fenwick is talking for talk's
sake, and humours him. He can get to the memory-subject later.</p>

<p>"A patient of mine," he says, "who's been living at Spezzia, was
telling me about a fruit that was very good there, <i>diosperi</i> he
called them. They must be very unlike sloes by his description."</p>

<p>"And naturally sloes made you think of them. I wonder what they
are&mdash;<i>diosperi</i>&mdash;<i>diosperi</i>&mdash;&mdash;" He repeated the word as though
trying to recall it. Dr.&nbsp;Conrad helped the identification.</p>

<p>"He said they are what the Japs call jelly-plums&mdash;great big fruit,
very juicy."</p>

<p>"I know. They're persimmons, or a sort of persimmons. We used to get
lots of them in California, and even up at the Klondyke...."</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly and remained silent. A sudden change in him was
too marked to escape notice, and there could be no doubt about the
cause. The doctor walked beside him, also silent, for a few paces.
Then he spoke:</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 404 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"You will have to bear this, Fenwick, and keep your head. It is just
as I told you it would be. It is all coming back." He laid his left
hand on his companion's shoulder as they stood side-by-side on the
chalk pathway, and with his right felt the wrist that was nearest
him. Fenwick was in a quiver all through his frame, and his pulse
was beating furiously as Dr.&nbsp;Conrad's finger touched it. But he
spoke with self-control, and his step was steady as they walked on
slowly together the moment after.</p>

<p>"It's all coming back. It <i>has</i> come back. I shall remember all in
time." Then he repeated Vereker's words, "I must keep my head. I
shall have to bear this," and walked on again in silence. The young
man beside him still felt he had best not speak yet. Just let the
physical perturbation subside. Talking would only make it worse.</p>

<p>They may have walked so for two minutes before Fenwick spoke again.
Then he roused himself, to say, with but little hint in his voice of
any sense of the oddity of his question: "Which is my dream?&mdash;this
or the other?" Then added: "That's the question I want to ask, and
nobody can answer."</p>

<p>"And of course all the while each of us knows perfectly well the
answer is simply 'Neither.' You are a man that has had an accident,
and lost his memory. Be patient, and do not torment yourself. Let it
take its own time."</p>

<p>"All right, doctor! Patience is the word." He spoke in an
undertone&mdash;a voice of acquiescence, or rather obedience. "Perhaps it
will not be so bad when I remember more." They walked on again.</p>

<p>Then Vereker, noting that during silence he brooded under the
oppression of what he had already recovered from the past, and to
all appearance struck, once or twice, on some new unwelcome vein of
thought, judging from a start or a momentary tension of the arm that
now held his, decided that it would be as well to speak to him now,
and delay no longer.</p>

<p>"Has anything come back to you, so far, that will unsettle your
present life?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;not that, thank God! Not so far as I can see. But much that
must disquiet it; it cannot be otherwise."</p>

<p>"Do you mind telling me?"</p>

<p>"No, surely, dear fellow!&mdash;surely I will tell you. Why should I

<!-- Page 405 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
not? But what I say to you don't repeat to Sally or her mother. Not
just now, you know. Wait!"</p>

<p>There was a recess in the wall of mortar-bedded flints that ran
along the path, which would give shelter from the wind to light a
cigar. Fenwick stopped and took two from a cigar-case, Sally's
present to him last Christmas, and offered one to Dr.&nbsp;Conrad, who,
however, didn't want to smoke so early. He lighted his own in the
recess, with only a slight tremor of the hand, barely visible even
to Vereker's experienced eye; and then, as he threw away the match,
said, without anything that could be called emotion, though always
with an apparent sense of his bewilderment at his own words:</p>

<p>"I am that man Harrisson that was in all the newspapers just about
the time of the&mdash;you remember&mdash;when I...."</p>

<p>Vereker failed for the moment to grasp the degree of his own
astonishment, and used the residuum of his previous calmness to say:</p>

<p>"I remember. The time of your accident."</p>

<p>"<i>Am</i> I that man? I mean ought I to say 'I <i>am</i> that man'? I know I
<i>was</i> that man, in my old dream. I know it now, in this one."</p>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;so much the better! You are a millionaire, Fenwick, with
mines at Klondyke...."</p>

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Conrad had been so taken aback at the suddenness of the
extraordinary revelation that his amazement was quite at a loss for
means of expression. A delayed laugh, not unmixed with a gasp,
expressed nothing&mdash;merely recorded a welcome to the good side of it.
For, of course, when one hears of Golconda one is bound to think it
good, failing evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>was</i> that man&mdash;Algernon Harrisson. Now, the question
is&mdash;and you'll have to help me here, Vereker. Don't look so
thunderstruck, old chap&mdash;Shall I be that man again or not?"</p>

<p>"Why not, in Heaven's name? How can you help it?" The speaker is too
dumbfounded, so far, to be able to get the whip hand of the
circumstances. But the pace may be slacker presently.</p>

<p>"Let's be steady!" Fenwick's voice, as he says this, has a sense of
ease in it, as though he were relieved by his disclosure. He takes
Vereker's arm in his again, and as they walk on together

<!-- Page 406 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
is
evidently on good terms with his cigar&mdash;so the doctor thinks&mdash;and
the tremor has gone from his hands. A short pause, and he goes on
speaking: "Until we pitched on the Klondyke just now I knew nothing
of this. I shall get it all back in time. Let me see!..."</p>

<p>The doctor recovered his presence of mind. "Stop a minute," said he.
"Do you know, Fenwick, if I were you I shouldn't try to tell
anything until you're clearer about the whole thing. Don't talk to
me now. Wait till you are in a state to know how much you wish to
tell." But Fenwick would have none of this. He shook his head
decidedly.</p>

<p>"I <i>must</i> talk to some one about it. And my wife I cannot...."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You will see. You need not be frightened of too many confidences. I
haven't recollected any grave misdemeanours yet. I'll keep them to
myself when they come. Now listen to what I can and do recollect
pretty clearly." He paused a second, as if his first item was shaky;
then said, "Yes!&mdash;of course." And went on as though the point were
cleared up.</p>

<p>"Of course! I went up to the Klondyke almost in the first rush, in
'97. I'll tell you all about that after. Others besides myself
became enormously rich that summer, but I was one of the luckiest.
However, I don't want to tell you about Harrisson at
Klondyke&mdash;(that's how I find it easiest to think of myself, third
person singular!)&mdash;but to get at the thing in the dream, that
concerns me most <i>now</i>. Listen!... Only remember this, Vereker dear!
I can only recall jagged fragments yet awhile. I have been stunned,
and can't help that...." He stopped the doctor, who was about to
speak, with: "I know what you are going to say; let it stand over a
bit&mdash;wait and be patient&mdash;all that sort of game! All very good and
sensible, but I <i>can't</i>!"</p>

<p>"Can't?"</p>

<p>"No! Can't&mdash;simply <i>can't</i>. Because, look you! One of the things
that has come back is that I am a married man&mdash;by which I mean that
Harrisson was. Oh dear! It <i>is</i> such an ease to me to think of
Harrisson as somebody else. You can't understand that." But Vereker
is thoroughly discomposed.</p>

<p>"But didn't you say&mdash;only just now&mdash;there was
nothing&mdash;<i>nothing</i>&mdash;to

<!-- Page 407 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
unsettle your present life? No; I can't
understand&mdash;I <i>can't</i> understand." His reply is to Fenwick's words,
but the reference is to the early part of his speech.</p>

<p>"You will understand it better if I tell you more. Let me do it my
own way, because I get mixed, and feel as if I might lose the clue
any moment. All the time I was with the Clemenceaux at Ontario I was
a married man&mdash;I mean that I <i>knew</i> I was a married man. And I
remember knowing it all that time. Indeed, I did! But if you ask me
who my wife was&mdash;she wasn't there, you know; you've got all that
clear?&mdash;why, I can't tell you any more than Adam! All I know is that
all that time little Ernestine was growing from a girl to a woman,
the reason I felt there could be no misunderstanding on that score
was that Clemenceau and his wife knew quite well I had been married
and divorced or something&mdash;there was something rum, long before&mdash;and
you know Papists would rather the Devil outright than have their
daughter marry a divorced man. But as to who the wife had been, and
what it was all about...."</p>

<p>He stopped again suddenly, seizing Vereker by the arm with a strong
hand that trembled as it had done before. His face went very white,
but he kept self-possession, as it were mechanically; so completely
that the long ash on his half-smoked cigar remained unbroken. He
waited a moment, and then spoke in a controlled way.</p>

<p>"I can remember nothing of the story; or what seems to come I <i>know</i>
is only confusion ... by things in it...." Vereker thought it might
be well to change the current of his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Who were the Clemenceaux at Ontario?" said he.</p>

<p>"Of course, I ought to tell you that. Only there were so many
things. Clemenceau was a jeweller at Ontario. I lived in the flat
over his shop, and used to see a great deal of his family. I must
have lived almost entirely among French Canadians while I was
there&mdash;it was quite three or four years...."</p>

<p>"And all that time, Fenwick, you thought of yourself as a married
man?"</p>

<p>"Married or divorced&mdash;yes. And long before that."</p>

<p>"It is quite impossible for me&mdash;you must see it&mdash;to form any picture
in my mind of how the thing presents itself to you."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 408 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"It seems&mdash;to me&mdash;perfectly incredible that you should have no
recollection at all of the marriage, or divorce, or whatever it
was...."</p>

<p>"I did not say I had no recollection <i>at all</i>. Listen. Don't you
know this, Vereker?&mdash;of course you do, though&mdash;how one wakes from a
hideous dream and remembers exactly the feeling it produced, and how
the same feeling comes back when one recalls from the dream some
fragment preserved from all one has forgotten of it&mdash;something
nowise horrible in itself, but from its associations in the dream?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, perfectly!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;that's my case. When I try to bring back the memories I know
I <i>must</i> have had at that time in Canada, nothing comes back but a
horror&mdash;something like a story read in boyhood and shuddered at in
the night&mdash;but all details gone. I mean all details with horror in
them. Because, do you know?..."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;&mdash;?" Vereker stopped beside him on the path, as Fenwick
stopped and hesitated. Utter perplexity almost forbidding speech was
the impression the doctor received of his condition at this moment.
After a moment's silence he continued:</p>

<p>"You will hardly believe me, but almost the only thing I can
revive&mdash;that is, have revived so far&mdash;is an occurrence that must
needs at the time have been a happiness and a delight. And yet it
now presents itself to me as an excruciating torment&mdash;as part of
some tragedy in which I had to be an actor, but of which I can seize
no detail that does not at once vanish, leaving mere pain and
confusion."</p>

<p>"What was it? You don't mind...."</p>

<p>"Mind telling you? Oh no!&mdash;why should I? I may be happier if I can
tell it. It's like this. I am at a railway-station in the heat
somewhere, and am expecting a girl who is coming to marry me. I can
remember the heat and our meeting, and then all is Chaos again.
Then, instead of remembering more, I go over and over again the old
thing as at first.... No! nothing new presents itself. Only the
railway-station and the palm-trees in the heat. And the train coming
slowly in, and my knowing that she is in it, and coming to marry
me."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 409 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Do you mean that the vision&mdash;or scene&mdash;in your mind stops dead, and
you don't see her get out of the carriage?"</p>

<p>They had walked on slowly again a short distance. Fenwick made
another halt, and as he flicked away a most successful crop of
cigar-ash that he had been cultivating&mdash;so it struck Vereker&mdash;as a
kind of gauge or test of his own self-control, he answered:</p>

<p>"I couldn't say that. Hardly! I see a girl or woman get out of the
carriage, but <i>not her</i>...!"</p>

<p>Vereker was completely at a loss&mdash;began to be a little afraid his
companion's brain might be giving way. "How <i>can</i> you tell that,"
said he, "unless you know who she ought to have been?"</p>

<p>Fenwick resumed his walk, and when he replied did so in a voice that
had less tension in it, as though something less painful had touched
his mind:</p>

<p>"It's rum, I grant you. But the whole thing is too rum to bear
thinking of&mdash;at least, to bear talking about. As to the exact reason
<i>why</i> I know it's not her, that's simple enough!"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Because Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick gets out of the train&mdash;my Rosey, here, Sally's
mother. And it's just the same with the only other approach to a
memory that connects itself with it&mdash;a shadowy, indistinct ceremony,
also in the heat, much more indistinct than the railway-station. My
real wife's image&mdash;Rosey's, here&mdash;just takes the place at the altar
where the other one should be, and prevents my getting at any
recollection of her. It is the only thing that makes the dream
bearable."</p>

<p>Vereker said nothing. He did not want to disturb any lull in the
storm in his companion's mind. After a slight pause the latter
continued:</p>

<p>"The way I account for it seems to me sufficient. I cannot conceive
any woman being to me what ... or, perhaps I should express it
better by saying I cannot connect the <i>wife-idea</i> with any image
except hers. And, of course, the strong dominant idea displaces the
feeble memory."</p>

<p>Vereker was ready with an unqualified assent at the moment. For
though Sally, as we have seen, had taken him into her confidence the
day after her mother's wedding&mdash;and, indeed, had talked over the
matter many times with him since&mdash;the actual truth was far too
strange to suggest itself offhand, as it would have

<!-- Page 410 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
been doing had
the doctor connected the fact that Sally's mother went out to India
to be married with this meeting of two lovers at a simmering
railway-station, name not known. The idea of the <i>impossible per se</i>
is probably the one a finite intelligence most readily admits, and
is always cordially welcome in intellectual difficulties&mdash;a
universal resolution of logical discords. In the case of these two
men, at that moment, neither was capable of knowing the actual truth
had he been told it, whatever the evidence; still less of catching
at slight connecting-links. Fenwick went on speaking:</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you will understand it&mdash;yes! I think, perhaps,
you might&mdash;that it's a consolation to me this way Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick comes
in. It seems to bring fresh air into what else would be&mdash;ugh!" He
shuddered a half-intentional shudder; then, dropping his voice, went
on, speaking quickly: "The thing makes part of some tragedy&mdash;some
sad story&mdash;something best forgotten! If I could only dare to hope I
might remember no more&mdash;might even forget it altogether."</p>

<p>"Perhaps if you could remember the whole the painfulness might
disappear. Does not anything in the image of the railway-station
give a clue to its whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"No. It hardly amounts to an image at all&mdash;more a fact than an
image. But the heat was a fact. And the dresses were all
white&mdash;thin&mdash;tropical...."</p>

<p>"Then the Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick that comes out of the train isn't dressed as
she dresses here?"</p>

<p>"Why, n-n-no!... No, certainly not. But that's natural, you know. Of
course, my mind supplies a dress for the heat."</p>

<p>"It doesn't diminish the puzzlement."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;but it does, though. Because, look here! It's not the
<i>only</i> thing. I find myself consciously making Rosey look <i>younger</i>.
I can't help my mind&mdash;my <i>now</i> mind&mdash;working, do what I will! But as
to where it was, I fancy I have a clue. I can remember
remembering&mdash;if you understand me&mdash;that I had been in
Australia&mdash;remembered it at Ontario&mdash;talked about it to Tina
Clemenceau...."</p>

<p>If Vereker had had any tendency to get on a true scent at this
point, the reference to Australia would have thrown him off it. And
the thought of the Canadian girl took Fenwick's mind once more

<!-- Page 411 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
to
his American life: "It was my thinking of that girl made all this
come back to me, you know. Just after you left us, when we were
throwing stones in the sea, last night...."</p>

<p>"Throwing stones in the sea?..."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;we went down to the waves on the beach, and my throwing a
stone in reminded me of it all, after. I was just going to get to
sleep, when, all of a sudden, what must I think of but Niagara!&mdash;at
least, the rapids. I was standing with Mademoiselle Tina&mdash;no one
else&mdash;on a rock overlooking the great torrent, and I threw a stone
in, and she said no one would ever see that stone again. I said,
'Like a man when he dies and is forgotten,' or something of that
sort. I recollect her now&mdash;poor child!&mdash;turning her eyes full on me
and saying, 'But I should not forget you, Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson.' You see
how it was? Only it seems a sort of disloyalty to the poor girl to
tell it. It was all plain, and she meant it to be. I can't remember
now whether I said, 'I can't marry you, Tina, because I don't know
that my wife is dead,' or whether I only thought it. But I know that
I then knew I was, or had been, married and divorced or deserted.
And it was that unhappy stone that brought it all back to me."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure that began it. I was just off, and some outlying scrap
of my mind was behindhand, and that stone saw it and pounced on it.
I remembered more after that. I know I was rather glad to start off
to the new gold river, because of Ernestine Clemenceau. I don't
think I should have cared to marry Ernestine. Anyhow, I didn't. She
seems to me Harrisson's affair now. Don't laugh at me, doctor!"</p>

<p>"I wasn't laughing." And, indeed, this was true. The doctor was very
far from laughing.</p>

<p>They had walked some little way inland, keeping along a road sunk in
the chalk. This now emerged on an exposed hill-side, swept by the
sea wind; which, though abated, still made talk less easy than in
the sheltered trench, or behind the long wall where Fenwick lit his
cigar. Vereker suggested turning back; and, accordingly, they
turned. The doctor found time to make up his mind that no harm could
be done now by referring to his interview with Rosalind, the day
before.</p>

<p>"Your wife told me yesterday that you had just had a tiresome
recurrence

<!-- Page 412 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
when you came out after us&mdash;at the jetty-end, you know."</p>

<p>"Surely! So I had. Did she tell you what it was?" Evidently, in the
stress and turmoil of his subsequent experience in the night, it had
slipped from him. The doctor said a reminding word or two, and it
came back.</p>

<p>"I know, I know. I've got it now. That was last night. But now&mdash;that
again! <i>Why</i> was it so horrible? That was dear old Kreutzkammer, at
'Frisco. What could there be horrible about <i>him</i>?..." A clear idea
shot into the doctor's mind&mdash;not a bad thing to work on.</p>

<p>"Fenwick!&mdash;don't you see how it is? These things are only horrible
to you <i>because</i> you half recollect them. The pain is only the
baffled strain on the memory, not the thing you are trying to
recover."</p>

<p>"Very likely." He assents, but his mind is dwelling on Kreutzkammer,
evidently. For he breaks into a really cheerful laugh, pleasant in
the ears of his companion. "Why, <i>that</i> was Diedrich Kreutzkammer!"
he exclaims, "up at that Swiss place. And I didn't know him from
Adam!"</p>

<p>"Of course it was. But look here, Fenwick&mdash;isn't what I say true?
Half the things that come back to you will be no pain at all when
you have fairly got hold of them. Only, <i>wait</i>! Don't struggle to
remember, but let them come."</p>

<p>"All right, old chap! I'll be good." But he has no very strong
convictions on the subject, clearly. The two walk on together in
silence as far as the low flint wall, in another recess of which
Fenwick lights another cigar, as before. Then he turns to the doctor
and says:</p>

<p>"Not a word of this to Rosey&mdash;nor to Sallykin!" The doctor seems
perplexed, but assents and promises. "Honest Injun!&mdash;as Sally says,"
adds Fenwick. And the doctor repeats that affidavit, and then says:</p>

<p>"I shall have to finesse a good deal. I can manage with Mrs.
Fenwick. But&mdash;I wish I felt equally secure with Miss Sally." He
feels very insecure indeed in that quarter, if the truth is told.
And he is afflicted with a double embarrassment here, as he has
never left Sally without her "miss" in speaking to Fenwick, while,
on the other hand, he holds a definite licence from her mother&mdash;is,

<!-- Page 413 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
as it were, a chartered libertine. But that's a small matter, after
all. The real trouble is having to look Sally in the face and
conceal anything.</p>

<p>"Miss who?" says Fenwick. "Oh&mdash;Sally, you mean! Of course she'll
rush the position. Trust her!" He can't help laughing as he thinks
of Sally, with Dr.&nbsp;Conrad vainly trying to protect his outworks.</p>

<p>The momentary hesitation about how to speak of Sally may have
something to do with Vereker's giving the conversation a twist. It
turns, however, on a point that has been waiting in his mind all
through their interview, ever since Fenwick spoke of his identity
with Harrisson.</p>

<p>"Look here, Fenwick," he says. "It's all very fine your talking
about keeping Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick in the dark about this. I know it's for
her own sake&mdash;but you can't."</p>

<p>"And why not? I can't have Rosey know I have another wife
living...."</p>

<p>"You don't know she's alive, for one thing!"</p>

<p>"H'm!... I don't <i>know</i>, certainly. But I should have known,
somehow, if she were dead. Of course, if further memory or inquiry
proves that she <i>is</i> dead, that's another matter."</p>

<p>"But, in the meanwhile, how can you prove your identity with
Harrisson and claim all your property without her knowing?... What I
mean is, I can't think it out. There may be a way...."</p>

<p>"My dear boy"&mdash;Fenwick says this very quietly&mdash;"that's exactly the
reason why I said you would have to help me to settle whether I
should be that man again or not. I say <i>not</i>, if the decision lies
with me."</p>

<p>"Not?&mdash;not <i>at all</i>?" The doctor fairly gasps; his breath is taken
away. Never perhaps was a young man freer from thought and influence
of money than he, more absorbed in professional study and untainted
by the supremacies of property. But for all that he was human, and
English, and theoretically accepted gold as the thing of things, the
one great aim and measure of success. Of other men's success, that
is, and <i>their</i> aim, not his. For he was, in his own eyes, a humble
plodder, not in the swim at all. But he ascribed to the huge sums
real people had a right to, outside the limits of the likes of him,
a kind of sacredness

<!-- Page 414 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
that grew in a geometrical ratio with their
increase. It gave him much more pain to hear that a safe had been
robbed of thousands in gold than he felt when, on opening a
wrapped-up fee, what seemed a guinea to the touch turned out a new
farthing and a shilling to the sight. It was in the air that he
lived in&mdash;that all of us live in.</p>

<p>So, when Fenwick made in this placid way a choice of conduct that
must needs involve the sacrifice of sums large enough to be spoken
of with awe, even in the sacred precincts of a bank, poor Dr.&nbsp;Conrad
felt that all his powers of counsel had been outshot, and that his
mind was reeling on its pedestal. That a poor man should give up his
savings <i>en bloc</i> to help a friend would have seemed to him natural
and reasonable; that he should do so for honest love of a woman
still more so; but that a millionaire should renounce his millions!
Was it decent? was it proper? was it considerate to Mammon? But that
must have been Fenwick's meaning, too. The doctor did not recover
his speech before Fenwick spoke again:</p>

<p>"Why should I claim all my property? How should I be the gainer if
it made Rosey unhappy?"</p>

<p>"I see. I quite see. I feel with you, you know; feel as you do. But
what will become of the money?"</p>

<p>"The poor darling money? Just think! It will lie neglected at the
bank, unclaimed, forsaken, doing no more mischief than when it was
harmless dust and nuggets in the sand of the Klondyke. While it was
there, gold was a bit&mdash;a mighty small bit&mdash;dearer than it has become
since. Now that it is in the keeping of chaps who won't give it up
half as easily as the Klondyke did, I suppose it has appreciated
again, as the saying is. The difference of cost between getting it
out of the ground and out of the bank is a negligible factor...."
Fenwick seemed to find ease in chatting economics in this way. Some
of it was so obviously true to Vereker that he at once concluded it
would be classed among fallacies; he had had experience of this sort
of thing. But he paid little attention, as he was thinking of how
much of this interview he could repeat to Sally, to whom every step
they took brought him nearer. The roar of a lion in his path was
every moment more audible to the ears of his imagination. And it
left him silent; but Fenwick went on speaking:</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 415 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"We won't trouble about the darling dust and nuggets; let them lie
in pawn, and wait for a claimant. They won't find Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson's
heir-at-law in a hurry. If ever proof comes of the death of Mrs.
Harrisson&mdash;whoever she was&mdash;I'll be Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson again. Till
then...."</p>

<p>"Till then what?"</p>

<p>"Till then, Vereker dear"&mdash;Fenwick said this very seriously, with
emphasis&mdash;"till then we shall do most wisely to say nothing further
to Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick or to Sally. You must see that it won't be possible
to pick and choose, to tell this and reserve that. I shall speak of
the recurrences of memory that come to me, as too confused for
repetition. I shall tell lies about them if I think it politic.
Because I can't have Rosey made miserable on any terms. As for the
chick, you'll have to manage the best you can."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best," the doctor says, without a particle of confidence
in his voice. "But about yourself, Fenwick?"</p>

<p>"I shall do very well, as long as I can have a chat with you now and
again. You've no idea what a lot of good it has done me, this
talking to you. And, of course, I haven't told you one-tenth of the
things I remember. There was one thing I wanted to say though just
now, and we got off the line&mdash;what was it now? Oh, I know, about my
name. It wasn't really Harrisson."</p>

<p>"Not really Harrisson? What was it then?" What next, and next?&mdash;is
the import of the speaker's face.</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if I know! But it's true, rum as it seems. I know I
knew it wasn't Harrisson every time I signed a cheque in America.
But as for what it <i>was</i>, that all belongs to the dim time before.
Isn't that them coming to meet us?"</p>

<p>Yes, it was. And there was something else also the doctor had had it
on his tongue to say, and it had got away on a siding. But it didn't
matter&mdash;it was only about whether the return of memory had or had
not been due to the galvanic battery on the pier.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF THE DOCTOR'S CAUTIOUS RESERVE, AND MRS. FENWICK'S STRONG
COMMON-SENSE. AND OF A LADY AT BUDA-PESTH. HOW HARRISSON WAS ONLY
PAST FORGOTTEN NEWSPAPERS TO DR. VEREKER. OF THE OCTOPUS'S PULSE,
HOW THE HABERDASHER'S BRIDE WOULD TRY ON AT TWO GUAS. A WEEK, AND OF
A PLEASANT WALK BACK FROM THE RAILWAY STATION</p>

<p>"You never mean to say you've been in the water?"</p>

<p>It was quite clear, from the bluish finger-tips of the gloveless
merpussy&mdash;for at St.&nbsp;Sennans sixes are not <i>de rigueur</i> in the
morning&mdash;that she <i>has</i> been in, and has only just come out. But
Fenwick, who asked the question, grasped a handful of loose black
hair for confirmation, and found it wet.</p>

<p>"Haven't I?" says the incorrigible one. "And you should have heard
the rumpus over getting a machine down."</p>

<p>"She's a selfish little monkey," her mother says, but forgivingly,
too. "She'll drown herself, and not care a penny about all the
trouble she gives." You see, Rosalind wouldn't throw her words into
this callous form if she was really thinking about the merpussy. But
just now she is too anxious about Gerry to be very particular.</p>

<p>What has passed between him and Dr.&nbsp;Conrad? What does the latter
know now more than she does herself? She falls back with him, and
allows the other two to go on in front. Obviously the most natural
arrangement.</p>

<p>"What has he told you, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad?" This is not unexpected, and the
answer is a prepared one, preconcerted under pressure between the
doctor and his conscience.</p>

<p>"I am going to ask you, Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick, to do me a very great
kindness&mdash;don't say yes without hearing what it is&mdash;to ask you to
allow me to keep back all your husband says to me, and to take for
granted that he repeats to you all he feels certain of himself in
his own recollections."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 417 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"He <i>has</i> told you more?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he has. But I am far from certain that anything he has said
can be relied upon&mdash;in his present state. Anyway, I should be very
sorry to take upon myself the responsibility of repeating it."</p>

<p>"He wishes you not to do so?"</p>

<p>"I think so. I should say so. Do you mind?"</p>

<p>"I won't press you to repeat anything you wish to keep back. But is
his mind easier? After all, that's the main point."</p>

<p>"That is my impression&mdash;much easier." He felt he was quite warranted
in saying this. "And I should say that if he does not himself tell
you again whatever he has been saying to me, it will only show how
uncertain and untrustworthy all his present recollections are. I
cannot tell you how strongly I feel that the best course is to leave
his mind to its own natural development. It may even be that the
partial and distorted images of events such as he has been speaking
of to me...."</p>

<p>"I mustn't ask you what they were?... Yes, go on."</p>

<p>"May again become dim and disappear altogether. If they are to do
so, nothing can be gained by dwelling on them now&mdash;still less by
trying to verify them&mdash;and least of all by using them as a stimulus
to further recollection."</p>

<p>"You think I had better not ask him questions?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. Leave him to himself. Keep his mind on other
matters&mdash;healthy occupations, surrounding life. I am certain of one
thing&mdash;that the effort to disinter the past is painful to him in
itself, quite independent of any painful associations in what he is
endeavouring to recall."</p>

<p>"I have seen that, too, in the slight recurrences he has had when I
was there. I quite agree with you about the best course to pursue.
Let us have patience and wait."</p>

<p>Of course, Vereker had not the remotest conception that the less
Fenwick remembered, the better his wife would be pleased. So the
principal idea in his mind at that moment was, what a very sensible
as well as handsome woman he was talking to! It was the way in which
most people catalogued Rosalind Fenwick. But her ready assent to his
wishes had intensified the doctor's first item of description. A
subordinate wave of his thought created

<!-- Page 418 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
an image of the girl
Fenwick must have pictured to himself coming out of the railway
carriage. He only repeated: "Let us have patience, and wait," with a
feeling of relief from possible further catechism.</p>

<p>But in order to avoid showing his wish to abate inquiry, he could
talk about aspects of the case that would not involve it. He could
tell of analogous cases well known, or in his own practice. For
instance, that of a Frenchwoman who wandered away from Amiens,
unconscious of her past and her identity, and somehow got to
Buda-Pesth. There, having retained perfect powers of using her
mother-tongue, and also speaking German fluently, she had all but
got a good teachership in a school, only she had no certificate of
character. With a great effort she recalled the name of a lady at
Amiens she felt she could write to for one, and did so. "Fancy her
husband's amazement," said Dr.&nbsp;Conrad, "when, on opening a letter
addressed to his wife in her own handwriting, he found it was an
application from Fr&auml;ulein Schmidt, or some German name, asking for a
testimonial!" He referred also to the many cases of the caprices of
memory he had met with in his studies of the <i>petit-mal</i> of
epilepsy, a subject to which he had given special attention. It may
have crossed his mind that his companion had fallen very thoroughly
in with his views about not dissecting her husband's case overmuch
for the present. But he put it down, if it did, to her strong
common-sense. It is rather a singular thing how very ready men are
to ascribe this quality&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;to a beautiful woman.
Especially if she agrees with them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the doctor was not very sorry when he saw that Sally
and Fenwick, on in front, had caught up with&mdash;or been caught up with
by&mdash;a mixed party, of a sort to suspend, divert, or cancel all
conversation of a continuous sort. Miss Gwendolen Arkwright and her
next eldest sister had established themselves on Fenwick's
shoulders, and the Julius Bradshaws had just intersected them from a
side-alley. The latter were on the point of extinction; going back
to London by the 3.15, and everything packed but what they had on.
It was a clear reprieve, till 3.15 at any rate.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt, thought Rosalind to herself, that her
husband's conversation with Vereker had made him easier in his mind

<!-- Page 419 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
than when she saw him last, just after breakfast. No doubt he was
all the better, too, for the merpussy's account of her exploit on
the beach; of how she managed to overrule old Gabriel and get a
machine put down, contrary to precedent, common caution, and public
opinion&mdash;even in the face of urgent remonstrance from her Swiss
acquaintance, almost as good a swimmer as herself; how she had
picked out a good big selvage-wave to pop in under, and when she got
beyond it enjoyed all the comfort incidental to being in bed with
the door locked. Because, you see, she exaggerated. However, one
thing she said was quite true. There were no breakers out beyond the
said selvage-wave, because the wind had fallen a great deal, and
seemed to have given up the idea of making any more white
foam-crests for the present. But there would be more wind again in
the night, said authority. It was only a half-holiday for Neptune.</p>

<p>Sally's bracing influence was all the stronger from the fact of her
complete unconsciousness of anything unusual. Her mother had said
nothing to her the day before of the revival of Baron Kreutzkammer,
nor had Dr.&nbsp;Conrad, acting under cautions given. And all Sally knew
of the wakeful night was that her mother had found Fenwick walking
about, unable to sleep, and had said at breakfast he might just as
well have his sleep out now. To which she had agreed, and had then
gone away to see if "the Tishies," as she called them, were blown
away, and had met the doctor coming to see if <i>she</i> was. So she was
in the best of moods as an antidote to mind-cloudage. And Fenwick,
under the remedy, seemed to her no more unlike himself than was to
be expected after not a wink till near daylight. The object of this
prolixity is that it may be borne in mind that Sally never shared
her mother's or her undeclared lover's knowledge of the strange
mental revival caused&mdash;as seemed most probable&mdash;by the action of the
galvanic battery on the previous day.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Vereker walked back to his Octopus, whom he had forsaken for an
unusually long time, with his brain in a whirl at the strange
revelation he had just heard. His medical experience had put him
well on his guard anent one possibility&mdash;that the whole thing might
be delusion on Fenwick's part. How could such

<!-- Page 420 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
an imperfect
memory-record be said to prove anything without confirmation from
without?</p>

<p>His habits of thought had qualified him to keep this possibility
provisionally in the background without forgetting it. There was
nothing in the mere knowledge of its existence to prevent his trying
to recall all he could of the story of the disappearance of
Harrisson, as he read it in the newspapers a year and a half ago.
There had been a deal of talk about it at the time, and great
efforts had been made to trace Harrisson, but without success. The
doctor lingered a little on his way, conscious that he could recall
very little of the Harrisson case, but too interested to be able to
leave his recollections dormant until he should get substantial
information. The Octopus could recollect all about it no doubt, but
how venture to apply to her? Or how to Sally? Though, truly, had he
done so, it would have been with much less hope of a result. Neither
Sally nor her mother were treasure-houses of the day's gossip, as
<i>his</i> mother was. "We must have taken mighty little notice of what
was going on in the world at the time," so thought the doctor to
himself.</p>

<p>What <i>did</i> he actually recollect? A paragraph headed "Disappearance
of a Millionaire" in a hurried perusal of an evening paper as he
rode to an urgent case; a repetition&mdash;several repetitions&mdash;on the
newspaper posters of the name Harrisson during the fortnight
following, chiefly disclosing supposed discoveries of the missing
man, sandwiched with other discoveries of their falsehood&mdash;clue and
disappointment by turns. He could remember his own perfectly
spurious interest in the case, produced by such announcements
staring at him from all points of the compass, and his own
preposterous contributions to talk-making about them, such as "Have
they found that man Harrisson yet?" knowing himself the merest
impostor all the while, but feeling it dutiful to be up-to-date. How
came no one of them all to put two and two together?</p>

<p>A gleam of a solution was supplied to the doctor's mind when he set
himself to answer the question, "How should I have gone about
suspecting it?" How, indeed? Ordinary every-day people&mdash;<i>you</i>'s and
<i>me</i>'s&mdash;can't lightly admit to our minds the idea that we have
actually got mixed up with the regular public people in the
newspapers. Have not even our innocent little announcements

<!-- Page 421 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
that we
have been born, or died, or got married, always had a look of having
got in by accident, or under some false pretence? Have we not felt
inflated when a relation of ours has had a letter to a newspaper
inserted, in real print, with his own name as bold as brass? Vereker
was not surprised, on thinking it over, that he personally had
missed the clue. And if he, why not others? Besides, all the
Harrisson talk had been superseded by some more exciting matter
before it had been recognised as possible that Fenwick's memory
might never come back.</p>

<p>Just as he arrived at Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden's a thought struck him&mdash;not
heavily; only a light, reminding flick&mdash;and he stopped a minute to
see what it had to say. It referred to his interview with Scotland
Yard, some six weeks after Fenwick's first appearance.</p>

<p>He could recall that in the course of his interview one of the
younger officials spoke in an undertone to his chief; who thereon,
after consideration, turned to the doctor and said, "Had not your
man a panama hat? I understood you to say so;" and on receiving an
affirmative reply, spoke again in an undertone to his subordinate to
the effect, half-caught by Vereker, that "Alison's hat was black
felt." Did he say by any chance Harrisson, not Alison? If so, might
not that account for a rather forbidding or opposive attitude on the
Yard's part? He remembered something of fictitious claimants coming
forward, representing themselves as Harrisson&mdash;desperate bidders for
a chance of the Klondyke gold. They might easily have supposed this
man and his quenched memory another of the same sort. Evidently if
investigation was not to suffer from overgrown suspicion, only young
and guileless official instinct could be trusted&mdash;plain-clothes
<i>ing&eacute;nus</i>. Dr.&nbsp;Conrad laughed to himself over a particularly
outrageous escapade of Sally's, who, when her mother said they
always sent such very young chicks of constables to Glenmoira Road
in the morning, impudently ascribed them to inspector's eggs, laid
overnight.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>"My pulse&mdash;feel it!" His Goody mother greeted the doctor with a
feeble voice from inarticulate lips, and a wrist outstretched. She
was being moribund; to pay him out for being behindhand.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 422 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
</div>

<p>He skipped all interims, and said, with negligible inaccuracy, "It's
only a quarter past."</p>

<p>"Don't talk, but feel!" Her failing senses could indulge a little
impatience; but it was like throwing ballast out of a balloon. She
meant to be all the worse directly.</p>

<p>Her son felt the outstretched wrist, and was relieved to find it
normal&mdash;almost abnormally normal, just before lunch! But he had to
pretend. A teaspoonful of brandy in half a glass of water, clearly!
He knew she hated it, but she had better swallow it down. <i>That</i> was
right! And he would hurry Mrs.&nbsp;Iggulden with lunch. However, Mrs.
Iggulden had been beforehand, having seen her good gentleman coming
and the table all laid ready, so she got the steak on, only she knew
there would something happen if too much hurry and sure enough she
broke a decanter. We do not like the responsibility of punctuation
in this sentence.</p>

<p>"I thought you had forgotten me," quoth the revived Goody to her
son, assisting her to lunch. But the excellent woman said <i>me</i> (as
if it was the name of somebody else, and spelt <i>M</i> double <i>E</i>) with
a compassionate moan.</p>

<p>Rosalind was glad to see her husband in good spirits again. He was
quite like himself before that unfortunate little galvanic battery
upset everything. Perhaps its effect would go off, and all he had
remembered of the past grow dim again. It was a puzzle, even to
Rosalind herself, that her natural curiosity about all Gerry's
unknown history should become as nothing in view of the unwelcome
contingencies that history might disclose. It spoke well for the
happiness of the <i>status quo</i> that she was ready to forego the
satisfaction of this curiosity altogether rather than confront its
possible disturbing influences. "If we can only know nothing about
it, and be as we are!" was the thought uppermost in her mind.</p>

<p>It certainly was a rare piece of good luck that, owing to Sally's
leaving the house before Fenwick appeared, and running away to her
madcap swim before he could join her and the doctor, she had just
avoided seeing him during the worst of his depression. Indeed, his
remark that he had not slept well seemed to account for all she had
seen in the morning. And in the afternoon, when the whole party,
minus the doctor, walked over to

<!-- Page 423 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
St.&nbsp;Egbert's Station for the
honeymoon portion of it to take its departure for town, and the
other three to say farewells, Fenwick was quite in his usual form.
Only his wife watched for any differences, and unless it was that he
gave way rather more freely than usual to the practice of walking
with his arm round herself or Sally, or both, she could detect
nothing. As the road they took was a quiet one, and they met
scarcely a soul, no exception on the score of dignity was taken to
this by Rosalind; and as for Sally, her general attitude was "Leave
Jeremiah alone&mdash;he shall do as he likes." L&aelig;titia's mental comment
was that it wasn't Oxford Street this time, and so it didn't matter.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>"I shall walk straight into papa's library," said that young married
lady in answer to an inquiry from Sally, as they fell back a little
to chat. "I shall just walk straight in and say we've come back."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose the Professor will say?"</p>

<p>"My dear!&mdash;it's the merest toss up. If he's got some very
interesting Greek or Ph&oelig;nician nonsense on hand, he'll let me
kiss him over his shoulder and say, 'All right&mdash;I'm busy.' If it's
only the Cosmocyclop&aelig;dia work&mdash;which he doesn't care about, only it
pays&mdash;he may look up and kiss me, or even go so far as to say:
'Well!&mdash;and where's master Julius?' But I don't expect he'll give
any active help in the collision with mamma, which is sure to come.
I rather hope she won't be at home the first time."</p>

<p>"Why? Wouldn't it be better to have it over and done with?" Sally
always wants to clinch everything.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; only the second time mamma's edge will be all taken
off, and she'll die down. Besides, the crucial point is Paggy
kissing her. It's got to be done, and it will be such a deal easier
if I can get Theeny and Classy kissed first." Classy was the married
sister, Clarissa. "After all, mamma must have got a shred of
common-sense somewhere, and she must know that when things can
neither be cured nor endured you have to pretend, sooner or later."</p>

<p>"You bottle up when it comes to that," said Sally philosophically.
"But I shouldn't wonder, Tishy, if you found your Goody aggravating,
too. She'll talk about haberdashers."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 424 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Oh, my dear, haberdashers are a trifle! If that was all she might
talk herself hoarse. Besides, I can stop that by the mantle
department."</p>

<p>"What about it? Oh, I know, though!&mdash;about your being worth two
guineas a week to try on. She would know you were not serious,
though."</p>

<p>"Would she? I'm not so sure about it myself&mdash;not sure I'm not
serious, I mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tishy! You don't mean you would go and try on at two guineas a
week?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know, Sally dear. If I'm to have my husband's
profession flung in my face at every turn, I may just as well have
the advantage of it by a side-wind. Think what two guineas a week
means! A hundred and four guineas a year&mdash;remember! guineas, not
pounds. And Paggy thinks he could get it arranged for us to go out
and dine together in the middle of the day at an Italian
restaurant...."</p>

<p>"I say, what a lark!" Sally immediately warms up to the scheme. "I
could come, too. Do you know, Tishy dear, I was just going to twit
you with the negro and his spots. But now I won't."</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>The Julius Bradshaws must have reached home early, as our story will
show later that the anticipated collision with the Dragon took place
the same evening. No great matter for surprise, this, to any one who
has noticed the energetic impatience for immediate town-event in
folk just off a holiday. These two were too keen to grapple with
their domestic problem to allow of delays. So, after getting some
dinner in a hurry at Georgiana Terrace, Bayswater, they must needs
cab straight away to Ladbroke Grove Road. As for what happened when
they got there, we shall know as much as we want of it later. For
the present our business lies with Fenwick and his wife; to watch,
in sympathy with the latter, for the next development in the strange
mental state of the former, and to hope with her, as it must be
confessed, for continued quiescence; or, better still, for a
complete return of oblivion.</p>

<p>It seemed so cruelly hard to Rosalind that it might not be. What had
she to gain by the revival of a forgotten past&mdash;a past her

<!-- Page 425 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
own
share of which she had for twenty years striven to forget? Utterly
guiltless as, conceivably, she may have known herself to be, she had
striven against that past as the guilty strive with the memory of a
concealed crime. And here was she, at the end of this twenty years,
with all she most longed for at the beginning in her possession,
mysteriously attained with a thoroughness no combination of
circumstances, no patience or forbearance of her own, no
self-restraint or generosity of her young husband's could possibly
have brought about. Think only of what we do know of this imperfect
story! Conceive that it should have been possible for the Algernon
Palliser of those days to know and understand it to the full;
indulge the supposition, however strained it may be, that his so
knowing it would not have placed him in a felon's dock for the
prompt and righteous murder of the betrayer&mdash;we take the first
convenient name&mdash;of the woman he loved. Convince yourself this could
have been; figure to yourself a happy wedded life for the couple
after Miss Sally had made her unconscious <i>d&eacute;but</i> with the supremest
indifference to her antecedents; construct a hypothetical bliss for
them at all costs, and then say if you can fill out the picture with
a relation between Sally and her putative father to be compared for
a moment to the one chance has favoured now for the stepfather and
stepdaughter of our story.</p>

<p>Our own imagination is at fault about the would-have-beens and
might-have-beens in this case. The only picture our mind can form of
what would have followed a full grasp of all the facts by Algernon
Palliser may be dictated or suggested by a memory of what sent Mr.
Salter, of Livermore's Rents, 1808, to the hospital. Rosalind knew
nothing of Mr.&nbsp;Salter, but she could remember well all Gerry's feats
of strength in his youth&mdash;all the cracking of walnuts in his
arm-joints and bending of kitchen-pokers across his neck&mdash;and also,
too well, an impotence against his own anger when provoked; it had
died down now to a trifle, but she could detect the trifle still.
Was such an executive to be trusted not to take the law into its own
hands, to fall into the grasp of an offended legislative function
later&mdash;one too dull to be able to define offence so as to avoid the
condemnation, now and again, of a culprit whose technical crime has
the applause of the whole human race? Had the author of all her
wrongs met

<!-- Page 426 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
his death at the hands of her young husband, might not
this husband of her later life&mdash;beside her now&mdash;be still serving his
time at the galleys, with every compulsory sharer in his
condemnation thinking him a hero?</p>

<p>It was all so much better as it had turned out. Only, could it
remain so?</p>

<p>At least, nothing was wrong now, at this moment. Whatever her
husband had said to Vereker in that morning walk, the present hour
was a breathing-space for Rosalind. The Kreutzkammer recurrence of
the previous evening was losing its force for her, and there had
been nothing since that she knew of. "Chaotic ideas"&mdash;the phrase he
had used in the night&mdash;might mean anything or nothing.</p>

<p>They came back from the railway-station by what was known to them as
the long short cut in contradistinction to the short short cut. The
latter, Sally said, had the courage of its opinions, while the
former was a time-serving cut. Could she have influenced it at the
first go-off&mdash;when it originally started from the V-shaped stile
your skirts stuck in, behind the Wheatsheaf&mdash;it might have mustered
the resolution to go straight on, instead of going off at a tangent
to Gattrell's Farm, half a mile out of the way. Was it intimidated
by a statement that trespassers would be prosecuted, nailed to an
oak-tree, legible a hundred years ago, perhaps, when its nails were
not rust, and really held it tight&mdash;instead of, as now, merely
countenancing its wish to remain from old habit? It may have been so
frightened in its timid youth; but if so, surely the robust
self-assertion of its straight start for Gattrell's had in it
something of contempt for the poor old board, coupled with its
well-known intention of turning to the left and going slap through
the wood the minute you (or it) got there. It may even have twitted
that board with its apathy in respect of trespassers. Had the threat
<i>ever</i> been carried out?</p>

<p>The long short cut was, according to the aborigines, a goodish step
longer than the road, geometrically. But there was some inner
sense&mdash;moral, ethical, spiritual&mdash;somehow metaphysical or
supraphysical&mdash;in which it was a short cut, for all that. The road
was a dale farther, some did say, along of the dust. But, then,
there was no dust now, because it was all laid. So the reason

<!-- Page 427 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
why
was allowed to lapse, and the fact to take care of itself for once.
Helped by an illusion that a path through an undergrowth of
nut-trees and an overgrowth of oak on such a lovely afternoon as
this wasn't distance at all&mdash;even when you got hooked in the
brambles&mdash;and by other palliative incidents, it was voted a very
short cut indeed. Certainly not too long for Rosalind's
breathing-space, and had it been even a longer short cut she would
have been well contented.</p>

<p>Every hour passed now, without a new recurrence of some bygone, was
going to give her&mdash;she knew it well beforehand&mdash;a sense of greater
security. And every little incident on the walk that made a change
in the rhythm of event was welcome. When they paused for
refreshments&mdash;ginger-beer in stone bottles&mdash;at Gattrell's, and old
Mrs.&nbsp;Gattrell, while she undid the corks, outlined the troubles of
her husband's family and her own, she felt grateful for both to have
kept clear of India and "the colonies." No memories of California or
the Arctic Circle could arise from Mrs.&nbsp;Gattrell's twin-sister
Debory, who suffered from information&mdash;internal information, mind
you; an explanation necessary to correct an impression of overstrain
to the mind in pursuit of research. Nor from her elder sister
Hannah, whose neuralgic sick headaches were a martyrdom to herself,
but apparently a source of pride to her family. Of which the
inflation, strange to say, was the greater because Dr.&nbsp;Knox was of
opinion that they would yield to treatment and tonics; though the
old lady herself was opposed to both, and said elder-flower-water.
She was a pleasant old personage, Mrs.&nbsp;Gattrell, who always shone
out as a beacon of robust health above a fever-stricken, paralysed,
plague-spotted, debilitated, and disintegrating crowd of
blood-relations and connexions by marriage. But not one of all these
had ever left the soil they were born on, none of Mrs.&nbsp;Gattrell's
people holding with foreign parts. And nothing whatever had ever
taken place at St.&nbsp;Egbert's till the railway come; so it wasn't
likely to arouse memories of the ice-fields of the northern cold or
the tiger-hunts of the southern heat.</p>

<p>Rosalind found herself asking of each new thing as it arose: "Will
this bring anything fresh to his mind, or will it pass?" The
wood-path the nut-tree growth all but closed over on either side she
decided was safe; it could taste of nothing but his English

<!-- Page 428 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
school-boyhood, before ever she knew him. But the sudden uprush of
the covey of partridges from the stubble, and their bee-line for a
haven in the next field&mdash;surely danger lay that way? Think what a
shot he was in the old days! However, he only said, "Poor dears,
they don't know how near the thirty-first is," and seemed to be able
to know that much from past experience without discomfort at not
knowing more.</p>

<p>When Sally proposed fortune-telling in connexion with a <i>bona-fide</i>
gipsy woman, who looked (she said) exactly like in "Lavengro," her
mother's first impulse was to try and recall if she and the Gerry of
old times had ever been in contact with gipsies, authentic or
otherwise, and, after decision in the negative, to feel that this
wanderer was more welcome than not, as having a tendency to conduct
his mind safely into new channels. Even the conclave of cows he had
to disperse that they might get through a gate&mdash;cows that didn't
mind how long they waited at it, having time on their
hands&mdash;suggested the same kind of query. She was rapidly getting to
look at everything from the point of view of what it was going to
remind her husband of. She must struggle against the habit that was
forming, or it would become insupportable. But then, again, the
thought would come back that every hour that passed without an alarm
was another step towards a safe haven; and who could say that in a
week or so things might not be, at least, no worse than they were
before this pestilent little galvanic battery broke in upon her
peace?</p>

<p>The fact that he had spoken of new memories to Vereker and had not
repeated them to her was no additional source of uneasiness; rather,
if anything, the contrary. For she could not entertain the idea that
Gerry would keep back from her anything he could tell to Vereker.
What had actually happened was necessarily inconceivable by
her&mdash;that a <i>recollected recollection</i> of his own marriage with her
should be interpreted by him as a memory of a marriage with some
other woman unknown, who might, for anything he knew, be still
living; that his inference as to the bearing of this on his own
conduct was that he should refrain, at any cost to himself, from
claiming, so to speak, his own identity; should accept the
personality chance had forced upon him for her sake; should even
forego the treasure of her sympathy,

<!-- Page 429 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
more precious far to him than
the heavy score to his credit at the banks of New York and San
Francisco, rather than dig up what needs must throw doubt on the
validity of their marriage, and turn her path of life, now smooth,
to one of stones and thorns. For that was the course he had sketched
out for himself; and had it only been possible for oblivion to draw
a sharp line across the slowly reviving record, and to say to
memory: "Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther," Fenwick might have
persevered in this course successfully till now. And then all our
story would have been told&mdash;at least, as far as Rosalind and Fenwick
go. And we might say farewell to them at this moment as the cows
reluctantly surrender passage-way of the long short cut, and Gerry
saunters on, seemingly at ease from his own mind's unwelcome
activities, with Sally on one arm and his wife in the other, and
Mrs.&nbsp;Grundy nowhere. But no conspiracies are possible to memory and
oblivion. They are a couple that act independently and consult
nobody's convenience but their own.</p>

<p>It may easily be that Rosalind, had she been mistress of all the
facts and taken in the full position, would have decided to run the
risks incidental to confronting her husband with his own past&mdash;taken
him into her confidence and told him. With the chance in view that
his reason might become unsettled from the chronic torment of
constant half-revivals of memory, would it not almost be safer to
face the acute convulsion of a sudden <i>&eacute;claircissement</i>&mdash;to put
happiness to the touch, and win or lose it all? Sally could be got
out of the way for long enough to allow of a resumption of
equilibrium after the shock of the first disclosure and a completely
established understanding that she <i>must not be told</i>, come what
might. Supposing that she could tell, and he could hear, the whole
story of twenty years ago better than when a terrible position
warped it for teller and hearer in what had since become to her an
intolerable dream&mdash;supposing this done, and each could understand
the other, might not the very strangeness of the fact that the small
new life that played so large a part in that dream had become Sally
since, and was the only means by which Sally could have been
established, might not this tell for peace? Might it not even raise
the question, "What does a cloud of twenty years ago matter at all?"
and suggest

<!-- Page 430 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
the answer, "Nothing? For did not Sally come to us out
of the cloud, and could we do without her?"</p>

<p>But Rosalind's half-insight into the patchwork of her husband's
perceptions warranted no step so decisive. Rather, if anything, it
pointed to a gradual resumption of his <i>status quo</i> of a few days
ago. After all, had he not had (and completely forgotten)
recurrences like that of the Baron and the fly-wheel? Well, perhaps
the last was a shade more vivid than the others. But then see now,
had he not forgotten it already to all outward seeming?</p>

<p>So that the minds of the two of them worked to a common
end&mdash;silence. Hers in the hope that the effects of the galvanic
current&mdash;if that did it&mdash;would die away and leave him rest for his;
his in the fear that behind the unraised curtain that still hid his
early life from himself was hidden what might become a baleful power
to breed unrest for hers.</p>

<p>But it all depended on his own mastery of himself. Except he told
it, who should know that he was Harrisson? And <i>how</i> he felt the
shelter of the gold! Who was going to suspect that a man who could
command wealth in six figures by disclosing his identity, would keep
it a secret? And for his wife's sake too! A pitiful four-or
five-figure man might&mdash;yes. But hundreds of thousands!&mdash;think of it!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF AN EXPEDITION AGAINST A GOODY, AND THE WALK BACK TO LOBJOIT'S.
AND THE WALK BACK AGAIN TO IGGULDEN'S. HOW FENWICK TOOK VEREKER'S
CONFIDENCE BY STORM. OF A COLLIER THAT PUT TO SEA. SUCCESSFUL
AMBUSCADE OF THE OCTOPUS. PROVISIONAL EQUILIBRIUM OF FENWICK'S MIND.
WHY BOTHER ABOUT HORACE? WHY NOT ABOUT PICKWICK JUST AS MUCH? THE
KITTEN WASN'T THERE&mdash;CERTAINLY&nbsp;NOT!</p>

<p>So it came about that during the remainder of that day and part of
the next Fenwick either made no further exploration of his past; or,
if he did so, concealed his discoveries. For he not only kept
silence with Rosalind, but even with Vereker was absolutely
reserved, never alluding to their conversation of the morning. And
the doctor accepted this reserve, and asked no questions.</p>

<p>As for Rosalind, she was only too glad to catch at the support of
the medical authority and to abstain from question or suggestion;
for the present certainly, and, unless her silence&mdash;as might
be&mdash;should seem to imply a motive on her part, to maintain it until
her husband revived the subject by disclosing further recollections
of the bygone time. Happily Sally knew nothing about it; <i>that</i> her
mother was convinced of. And Sally wasn't likely to know anything,
for Vereker's professional discretion could be relied on, even if
her suspicions were excited. And, really, except that Fenwick seemed
a little drowsy and reflective, and that Rosalind had a semitone of
consolation in her manner towards him, there was nothing to excite
suspicion.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>After the cows&mdash;this is an expression borrowed from Sally, later in
the afternoon&mdash;conversation flagged through the rest of the walk
home. Except for regrets, more than once expressed, that it would be
much too late for tea when we got in, and a passing

<!-- Page 432 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
word on the
fact that at the seaside one got as greedy as some celebrated
glutton&mdash;a Roman emperor, perhaps&mdash;very few ideas were interchanged.
But a little conversation was made out of the scarcity of a good
deal, for the persistent optimism of Sally recognised that it was
awfully jolly saying nothing on such a lovely evening. Slight
fatigue, combined with the beauty of sky and sea and distant
downland, the lengthening shadows of the wheatsheaves, and the
scarlet of poppies in the stubble, seemed good to justify
contemplation and silence. It was an hour to caress in years to
come, none the less that it was accepted as the mere routine of
daily life in the short term of its existence. It was an hour that
came to an end when the party arrived at the hedge of the unripe
sloes that had checked the onset of Albion Villas towards the new
town, and passed through the turnstile Fenwick and Vereker had
passed through in the morning. Then speech came back, and each did
what all folk invariably do after a long spell of silence&mdash;revealed
what they were being silent about, or seemed to be. Most likely
Fenwick's contribution was only a blind, as his mind must have been
full of many thoughts he wished to keep to himself.</p>

<p>"I wonder when Paganini's young woman's row with her mother's going
to come off&mdash;to-day or to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I was wondering whether it would come off at all. I dare say she'll
accept the inevitable." Thus Rosalind, and for our part we believe
this also was not quite candid&mdash;in fact, was really suggested by her
husband's remark. But Sally's was a genuine disclosure, and really
showed what her mind had been running on.</p>

<p>"I've been meditating a Crusade," she said, with remoteness from
current topics in her voice. And both her companions immediately
made concessions to one that seemed to them genuine as compared with
their own.</p>

<p>"Against whom, kitten?" said her mother.</p>

<p>And Fenwick reinforced her with, "Yes, who's the Crusade to be
against, Sarah?"</p>

<p>"Against the Octopus." And Sally says this with the most perfectly
unconscious gravity, as though a Crusade against an octopus was a
very common occurrence in every-day life. The eyes of her companions
twinkle a little interchange across her unseen,

<!-- Page 433 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
but are careful to
keep anything suggesting a smile out of their voices as they apply
for enlightenment.</p>

<p>"Because of poor Prosy," Sally explains. "You'll see now. She won't
allow him to come round this evening, you see if she does!" She is
so intent upon her subject-matter that they might almost have smiled
aloud without detection, after all.</p>

<p>"When's it to come off, Sarah&mdash;the Crusade?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of going round this evening if he doesn't turn up."</p>

<p>"Suppose we all go," Fenwick suggests. And Rosalind assents. The
Crusade may be considered organized. "We'll give him till
eight-forty-five," Sally says, forecasting strategy, "and then if he
doesn't come we'll go."</p>

<p>Eight-forty-five came, but no doctor. So the Crusade came off as
arranged, with the result that the Christian forces, on arriving in
the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, found that the Octopus responsible
for the personation of the Saracens had just gone to bed. It was an
ill-advised Crusade, because if the Christians had only had a little
patience, the released prisoner would have looked round as soon as
his janitor was asleep. As it turned out, no sooner were the
visitors' voices audible than the Octopus became alive to the
pleasures of society, and renounced sleep in its favour. She would
slip something on and come down, and did so. Her doing so was out of
keeping with the leading idea of the performance, presenting the
Paynim as an obliging race; but a meek and suffering one, though it
never aired its grievances. These, however, were the chief subjects
of conversation during the visit, which, in spite of every failure
in dramatic propriety, was always spoken of in after days as "the
Crusade." It came to an end in due course, the Saracen host retiring
to bed, with benedictions.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Vereker walked back with our friends to Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit's through the
sweet night-air a considerate little shower of rain, that came down
while they were sympathetically engaged, had just washed clean.
Vapour-drifts that were wavering between earth and sky, and
sacrificing their birthright of either cloudship or foghood, were
accompanying a warm sea-wind towards the north. Out beyond, and
quite clear of all responsibility for them and

<!-- Page 434 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
theirs, was a
flawless heaven with the stellar and planetary universe in it,
pitiless and passionless eyes perhaps&mdash;as Tennyson calls them&mdash;and
strange fires; but in this case without power to burn and brand
their nothingness into the visitors to St.&nbsp;Sennans, who laughed and
talked and smoked and took no notice; and, indeed, rather than
otherwise, considered that Orion's Belt and Aldebaran had been put
there to make it a fine night for them to laugh and talk and smoke
in.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to Vereker, after his walk with Fenwick in the
morning, to find the latter like his usual cheerful self again. The
doctor had had rather a trying time with his Goody mother, so that
the day had been more one of tension than of peace, and it was a
heavenly respite to him from filial duties dutifully borne, to walk
home with the goddess of his paradise&mdash;the paradise that was so soon
to come to an end and send him to the release of his "locum," Mr.
Neckitt. Never mind. The having such a time to look back to in the
future was quite as much as one general practitioner, with a duty to
his mother, could in reason expect. Was Dr.&nbsp;Conrad aware, we wonder,
how much the philosophical resignation that made this attitude of
thought possible was due to the absence of any other visible
favoured applicant for Miss Sally, and the certainty that he would
see her once or twice a week at least after he had gone back to his
prescriptions and his diary of cases?</p>

<p>Probably he wasn't; and when, on arriving at Lobjoit's, Fenwick
announced that he didn't want to go in yet, and would accompany the
doctor back to Iggulden's and take a turn round, the only misgiving
that could try for an insecure foothold in the mind now given up to
a delirium it called Sally was one that Fenwick might have some new
painful memory to tell. But he was soon at rest about this. Fenwick
wasn't going to talk about himself. Very much the reverse, if one's
own reverse is some one else. He was going to talk about the doctor,
into whose arm he slipped his own as soon as he had lighted his
second cigar. For they had not walked quick from Iggulden's.</p>

<p>"Now tell me about Sir Dioscorides Nayler and the epileptiform
disorders."</p>

<p>"Miss Sally's been telling you...."</p>

<p>"No, she didn't&mdash;Sally did." Both laughed. The doctor will make

<!-- Page 435 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
it
Sally next time&mdash;that's understood. "You told Sally and she told me.
What's the damage to be?"</p>

<p>"How much did Sally tell you?" The little formality comes easier to
the doctor's shyness as it figures, this time, quotation-wise. It is
a repeat of Fenwick's use of it.</p>

<p>"Sally said three thousand."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I told her. But it's not official. He may want
more. He may let me have it for three. Only I don't know why I
should have it for less than any one else."</p>

<p>"Never you mind why! That's no concern of yours, my dear boy. What
you've got to think of is of yourself and Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker. Dioscorides
will take care of himself&mdash;trust him!"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, I have to think of my mother." One can hear in the
speaker's voice what may be either self-reproach for having
neglected this aspect of the case, or very tolerant indictment of
Fenwick for having mistakenly thought he had done so.</p>

<p>"What's the man thinking of? Of course you have, but I didn't mean
your mother. She's a dear old lady"&mdash;this came grudgingly&mdash;"but I
didn't mean her. I meant the Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker that's to come. Your wife,
dear fellow, your wife."</p>

<p>The way the young man flushed up, hesitated, stammered, couldn't
organize a sane word, amused Fenwick intensely. Of course he was, so
to speak, quite at home&mdash;understood the position thoroughly. But he
wasn't going to torment the doctor. He was only making it impossible
for him to avoid confession, for his own sake. He did not wait for
the stammering to take form, but continued:</p>

<p>"I mean the young lady you told Sally about&mdash;the young lady you are
hesitating to propose to because there'll be what you call
complications in medicine&mdash;complications about your mamma, to put it
plainly.... Oh yes, of course, Sally told me all about it directly."
Vereker cannot resist a laugh, for all his embarrassment, a laugh
which somehow had the image of Sally in it. "She <i>would</i>, you know.
Sally's the sort of party that&mdash;that, if she'd been Greek, would
have been the daughter of an Arcadian shepherdess and a
thunderbolt."</p>

<p>"Of course she would. I say, Fenwick, look here...."</p>

<p>"Have another cigar, old man."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 436 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"No, I've smoked enough. That one's lasted all the time since we
came out. Look here&mdash;what I want to say is ... well, that I was a
great fool&mdash;did wrong in fact&mdash;to talk to Sally about that young
lady...."</p>

<p>"And to that young lady about Sally," Fenwick says quietly. For half
a second&mdash;such alacrity has thought&mdash;Vereker takes his meaning
wrong; thinks he really believes in the other young lady. Then it
flashes on him, and he knows how his companion has been seeing
through him all the while. But so lovable is Fenwick, and so much
influence is there in the repose of his strength, that there is no
resentment on Vereker's part that he should be thus seen through. He
surrenders at discretion.</p>

<p>"I see you know," he says helplessly.</p>

<p>"Know you love Sally?&mdash;of course I do! So does her mother. So does
yours, for that matter. So does every one, except herself. Why, even
you yourself know it! <i>She</i> never will know it unless she hears it
on the best authority&mdash;your own, you know."</p>

<p>"Ought I to tell her? I know I was all wrong about that humbug-girl
I cooked up to tell her about. I altogether lost my head, and was a
fool."</p>

<p>"I can't see what end you proposed to yourself by doing it," says
Fenwick a little maliciously. "If Sally had recommended you to speak
up, because it was just possible the young lady might be pining for
you all the time, you couldn't have asked her <i>her</i> name, and then
said, 'That's hers&mdash;you're her!' like the fat boy in 'Pickwick.'
No!&mdash;I consider, my dear boy, that you didn't do yourself any good
by that ingenious fiction. You know all the while you wouldn't have
been sorry to think she understood you."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I didn't think she did. I really don't know what
I did or didn't think. I quite lost my head over it, that's the
truth."</p>

<p>"Highly proper. Quite consistent with human experience! It's the
sort of job chaps always do lose their heads over. The question now
is, What are we going to do next?" Which meant what was Vereker
going to do next? and was understood by his hearer in that sense. He
made no answer at the moment, and Fenwick was not going to press for
one.</p>

<p>A Newcastle collier had come in to deliver her cargo some days
since,

<!-- Page 437 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
before the wind sprang up, and the coal-carts had been
passing and repassing across the sands at low water; for there was a
new moon somewhere in the sky when she came, as thin as a sickle,
clinging tight round the business moon that saw to the spring-tides,
a phantom sphere an intrepid star was daring to go close to. This
brig had not been disappointing her backers, for wagers had been
freely laid that she would drag her moorings in the wind, and drift.
Fenwick and Vereker stopped in their walk to lean on the wooden rail
above the beach that skirted the two inclines, going either way, up
which the waggons had been a couple of hours ago scrambling over the
shingle against time, to land one more load yet while the ebb
allowed it. They could hear the yeo-yeo! of the sail-hoisters at
work on the big mainsail abaft, and wondered how on earth she was
going to be got clear with so little sea-way and the wind dead in
shore. But they were reassured by the ancient mariner with the
striped shirt, whose mission in life seemed to be to stand about and
enlighten land-minds about sea-facts. The master of yander craft had
doon that much afower, and he'd do it again. Why, he'd known him
from three year old, the striped shirt had! Which settled the
matter. Then presently the clink-clink of the windlass dragging at
the anchor. They watched her in silence till, free of her moorings,
any one could have sworn she would be on shore to a certainty. But
she wasn't. She seemed mysteriously to be able to manage for
herself, and just as a berth for the night on the shingle appeared
inevitable, leaned over to the wind and crept away from the land,
triumphant.</p>

<p>Then, the show being over, as Fenwick and Vereker turned to look the
lateness of the hour in the face, and get home to bed, the latter
answered the question of the former, as though he had but just asked
it.</p>

<p>"Speak to Sally. I shall have to." And then added, with an awestruck
face and bated breath: "But it's <i>awful</i>!" A moment after he was
laughing at himself, as he said to his companion, referring to a
very palpable fact, "I don't wonder I made you laugh just now."</p>

<p>They walked on without much said till they came to Iggulden's; when
the doctor, seeing no light in the sitting-room, hoped his worthy
mother had fulfilled a promise made when they came away,

<!-- Page 438 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
and gone
to bed. It was then past eleven. But he was reckoning without his
host.</p>

<p>Fenwick said to him, as they stood on Iggulden's threshold and
doormat respectively&mdash;presuming rashly, on imperfect information, to
delay farewells&mdash;"Now look here, Conrad, my dear boy (I like your
name Conrad), don't you go and boil over to Sally to-morrow, nor
next day. You'll only spoil the rest of your stay, maybe.... What!
well&mdash;what I mean is that nothing I say prejudices the kitten.
You'll understand that, I'm sure?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. Of course, if Sally were to say she knew somebody she
would like a deal better, there's no reason why she shouldn't.... I
mean <i>I</i> couldn't complain."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes! I see. You'd exonerate her. Good boy! Very proper." And
indeed the doctor had felt, as the words passed his lips, that he
was rather a horrid liar. But the point didn't matter. Fenwick
laughed it off: "Just you take my advice, and refer the matter to
the kitten the last day you're here. Monday, won't it be? And don't
think about it!"</p>

<p>"Oh no! I'm a philosophical sort of chap, I am! Never in extremes.
Good-night!"</p>

<p>"I see. <i>Sperat infestis metuit secundis alteram sortem bene
pr&aelig;paratum pectus</i>&mdash;Horace." Fenwick ran this through in a breath;
and the doctor, a little hazy in school-memories of the classics,
said, "What's that?" and began translating it&mdash;"The bosom well
prepared for either lot, fears...." Fenwick caught him up and
completed the sentence:</p>

<p>"Fears what is good, and hopes for what is not. Cut away to bed, old
chap, and sleep sound...." Then he paused a moment, as he saw the
doctor looking a question at him intently, and just about to speak
it. He answered it before it came:</p>

<p>"No, no! Nothing more. I mean to forget all about it, and take my
life as it stands. Bother Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson!" He dropped his voice to
say this; then raised it again. "Don't you fret about me, doctor.
Remember, I'm Algernon Fenwick! Good-night!"</p>

<p>"Good-night!" And then the doctor, with the remains of heart-turmoil
in him, and a brain reeling, more or less, went up into what he
conceived to be an empty dark room, and was disconcerted

<!-- Page 439 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
by an
ill-used murmur in the darkness&mdash;a meek, submissive voice of one
accustomed to slights:</p>

<p>"I told her to blow it out and go to bed. It is all&mdash;quite&mdash;right,
my dear. So do not complain. Now help me with my things, and I will
get to bed."</p>

<p>"My dear mother! I <i>am</i> so sorry. I had no idea you had not gone
long ago!"</p>

<p>"My dear!&mdash;it does not matter in the least now. What is done, is
done. Be careful with the grease over my work. These candles drop
dreadfully, unless you hold them exactly upright. And gutter. Now
give me your arm, and I will go to bed. I <i>think</i> I shall sleep."
And the worthy woman was really&mdash;if her son could only have got his
eyes freed from the scales of domestic superstition, and seen
it&mdash;intensely happy and exultant at this fiendish little piece of
discomfort-mongering. She had scored; there was no doubt of it. She
was even turning it over in her own mind whether it would not bear
repetition at a future time; and quite intended, if so, to enjoy
herself over it. Now the doctor was contrite and heavy at heart at
his cruel conduct; walking about&mdash;just think!&mdash;and talking over his
own affairs while his self-sacrificing mother was sitting in the
dark, with the lamp out! To be sure there was no visible reason why
she should have had it put out, except as a picturesque and
imaginative way of rubbing her altruism into its nearest victim.
Unless, indeed, it was done in order that the darkened window should
seem to announce to the returning truant that she had gone to bed,
and to lull his mind to unconsciousness of the ambush that awaited
him.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the doctor was so impressed with his own delinquency that he
felt it would be impossible, the lamp having been put out, to take
his mother into his confidence about his conversation with Fenwick.
Which he certainly would have done&mdash;late as the hour was&mdash;if it had
been left in. So he said good-night, and carried the chaos of his
emotions away to bed with him, and lay awake with them till
cock-crow.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>As Fenwick walked back home, timing his pace by his expectation of
his cigar's duration, he wondered whether, perhaps, he had not been
a little rash. He felt obliged to go back on interviews

<!-- Page 440 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
with Sally,
in which the doctor had been spoken of. He recalled for his
justification one in particular. The family conclave at Krakatoa
Villa had recurred to a remark of Rosalind's about the drawback to
Vereker's practice of his bachelorhood. He was then, as it were,
brought up for a second reading, and new clauses added to him
containing schedules of possible wives. Fenwick had noticed, then,
that Sally's assent to the insertion of any candidate's name turned
on two points: one, the lady's consent being taken for granted; the
other, that every young single female human creature known by name
or describable by language was actually out of the question, or
inadmissible in its answer. She rejected almost all applicants for
the post of a doctor's wife without examining their claims, on the
ground of moral or physical defect&mdash;as, for instance, you never
would go and tie up poor Prosy to a wife that golloped. Sylvia
Peplow, indeed! Interrogated about the nature of "golloping," Sally
could go no nearer than that Miss Peplow looked as if she couldn't
help it. And her sister was worse: she was perfectly pecky, and shut
up with a click. And as for the large Miss Baker&mdash;why, you knew how
large <i>she</i> was, and it would be quite ridiculous! Besides, her
stupidity!</p>

<p>The only candidates that got the least consideration owed their
success to their names or expectations. Caroline Smith had, or would
have sometime, a thousand a year. But she squinted. Still, she might
be thought over. Mrs.&nbsp;Pollicitus Biggs's cousin Isabella would have
two thousand when her mother died, but the vitality of the latter
was indescribable. Besides, she was just like her name, Isabella,
and did her hair religiously. There was Chariclea Epimenides,
certainly, who had got three thousand, and would have six more. She
might be worth thinking of....</p>

<p>"Why don't you have him yourself, Sarah?" Fenwick had asked at this
point. Rosalind had just left the room to speak to Ann. But he
didn't want Sarah to be obliged to answer, so he went on: "Why are
all these young ladies' incomes exactly in round thousands?"</p>

<p>To which Sally had replied: "They always are, when you haven't got
'em." But had fallen into contemplation, and presently said&mdash;out of
the blue&mdash;"Because I'm an unsettled sort of party&mdash;a vagrant. I
shouldn't do for a G.P.'s wife, thank you,

<!-- Page 441 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
Jeremiah! I should like
to live in a caravan, and go about the country, and wood fires out
of doors." Was it, Fenwick wondered, the gipsies they had seen
to-day that had made her think of this? and then he recalled how he
afterwards heard the kitten singing to herself the old ballad:</p>

<p class="song">
"What care I for my goose-feather bed?<br />
What care I for my money oh?"
</p>

<p>and hearing her so sing had somehow imputed to the parade of bravado
in the swing of its rhythm a something that might have belonged to a
touched chord. Like enough a mistake of his, said Reason. But for
all that the reminiscence played its part in soothing Fenwick's
misgivings of his own rashness.</p>

<p>"The kitten's all right," said he to himself. "And if she doesn't
want Master Conrad, the sooner he knows it the better!" But he had
little doubt of the course things would take as he stopped to look
at that venturesome star, that seemed to be going altogether too
near the moon for safety.</p>

<p>In a few moments he turned again towards home. And then his mind
must needs go off to the thing of all others he wished not to think
of&mdash;<i>himself</i>. He had come to see this much clearly, that until the
veil floated away from between him and his past and left the whole
atmosphere transparent, there could be no certainty that a
recrudescence of that past would not be fatal to his wife's
happiness. And inevitably, therefore, to his own. Having once
formulated the idea that for the future <i>he</i> was to be one person
and Harrisson another, he found its entertainment in practice easier
than he had anticipated. He had only to say to himself that it was
for her sake that he did it, and he did not find it altogether
impossible to dismiss his own identity from the phantasmagoria that
kept on coming back and back before his mind, and to assign the
whole drama to another person; to whom he allowed the name of
Harrisson all the easier from his knowledge that it never had been
really his own. Very much the easier, too, no doubt, from the sense
that the function of memory was still diseased, imperfect,
untrustworthy. How could it be otherwise when he still was unable to
force it back beyond a certain limit? It was mainly a vision of
America, and, previous to that, a mystery of interminable avenues of
trees, and an

<!-- Page 442 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
inexplicable horror of a struggle with death. There
he always lost himself. In the hinterland of this there was that
vision of a wedding somewhere. And then bewilderment, because the
image of his living wife, his very soul of the world he now dwelt
in, the woman whose daughter had grown into his heart as his
own&mdash;yes, not only the image, but the very name of her&mdash;had come in
and supplanted that of the forgotten wife of that forgotten day. So
much so that more than once, in striving to follow the clue given by
that railway-carriage, his mind had involuntarily called the warm
living thing that came into his arms from it "Rosey." In the face of
that, what was the worth of anything he should recollect now, that
he should not discard it as a mere phantasm, for her sake? How
almost easy to say to himself, "that was Harrisson," and then to
add, "whoever he was," and dismiss him.</p>

<p>Do you&mdash;you who read&mdash;find this so very difficult to understand? Can
you recall no like imperfect memory of your own that, multiplied a
hundredfold, would supply an analogy, a standpoint to look into
Fenwick's disordered mind from?</p>

<p>After his delirious collision with his first vigorous revival of the
past, he was beginning to settle down to face it, helped by the
talisman of his love for Rosalind, whom it was his first duty to
shield from whatever it should prove to hold of possible injury to
her. That happy hour of the dying sunset in the shorn cornfields,
with her and Sally and the sky above and the sea beyond, had gone
far to soothe the perturbation of the night. And his talk of the
morning with this young man he had just left had helped him
strongly. For he knew in his heart he could safely go to him again
if he could not bear his own silence, could trust him with whatever
he could tell at all to any one. Could he not, when he was actually
ready to trust him with&mdash;Sally?</p>

<p>So, though he was far from feeling at rest, a working equilibrium
was in sight. He could acquiesce in what came back to him, as it
came; need never struggle to hasten or retard it. Little things
would float into his mind, like house-flies into the ray from a
shutter-crack in a darkened room, and float away again uncaptured,
or whizz and burr round and against each other as the flies do, and
then decide&mdash;as the flies do&mdash;that neither concerns the other and
each may go his way. But he was nowise bound

<!-- Page 443 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
to catch these things
on the wing, or persuade them to live in peace with one another. If
they came, they came; and if they went, they went.</p>

<p>Such a one caught his thoughts, and held them for a moment as,
satisfied that astronomy would see to that star, he turned to go
straight home to Lobjoit's. That would just last out the cigar. But
what was it now? What was the fly that flew into his sun-ray this
time, that it should make him remember a line of Horace, to be so
pat with it, and to know what it meant, too?</p>

<p>But this fact, that he could not tell how he came to know its
meaning, showed him how decisively the barrier line across the
memory of his boyhood was drawn, or, it might be, his early manhood.
He could not remember, properly speaking, the whole of his life in
the States, but he could remember telling a man&mdash;one Larpent, a man
with a club-foot, at Ontario&mdash;that he had been there over fifteen
years. This man has nothing to do with this story, but he happens to
serve as an illustration of the disjointed way in which small
details would tell out clear against a background of confusion. Why,
Fenwick could remember his face plainly&mdash;how close-shaven he was,
and black over the razor-land; how his dentist had inserted an
artificial tooth that didn't match, and shone out white. But as to
the fifteen years he had spent in the States, that he had told Mr.
Larpent of, they grew dimmer and dimmer as he tried to carry his
recollection further back. Beyond them&mdash;or rather, longer ago than
they, properly speaking&mdash;came that endless, intolerable labyrinth of
trees, and then, earlier still, that railway-carriage. It was
getting clearer; but the worst of it was that the clearer it got,
the clearer grew the Rosey that came out of it. As long as that went
on, there was nothing of it all he could place faith in. He had been
told that no man could be convinced, by his own reason, of his own
hallucination. He would supply a case to the contrary. It would
amuse him one day, if ever he came to know that girl of the
railway-carriage was dead, to tell Rosalind all his experiences, and
how bravely he fought against what he knew to be delusion.</p>

<p>But he must make an effort against this sort of thing. Here was he,
who had just made up his mind&mdash;so he phrased it&mdash;to remain himself,
and refuse to be Harrisson, no sooner was he left alone for a few
minutes than he must needs be raking up the

<!-- Page 444 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
past. And that, too,
because of a line of Horace!&mdash;sound in itself, but quite cut asunder
from its origin, the book he read it in, or the voice he heard read
it. What did that line matter? Leave it for Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson in that
state of pre-existence. As well make a point of recalling the
<i>provenance</i> of any little thing that had happened in this his
present life. Well, for instance, Mary and the fat boy in
"Pickwick." Rosalind had read him that aloud, he knew, but he
couldn't say when. Was he going to worry himself to recall that
which could do him no harm to know? Surely not. And if so, why
strive to bring back things better forgotten? It is useless to
endeavour to make the state of Fenwick's mind, at this point of the
imperfect revival of memory, appear other than incredible. A person
who has had the painful experience of forgetting his own name in a
dream would perhaps understand it best. Or, without going so far,
can no help be got towards it from our frequent certainties about
some phrase (for instance) that we think we cannot possibly forget?
about some date that we believe no human power will ever obliterate?
And in five minutes&mdash;gone&mdash;utterly gone! Truly, there is no evidence
but a man's own word for what he does or does not, can or cannot,
recollect.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>"I say, Rosey, when was it you read to me about Mary and the fat boy
in 'Pickwick'?" Fenwick, having suggested a doubt to himself about
his power to recall what he supposed to have happened recently, had,
of course, set about doing it directly. His question was asked of
his wife as he came into her bedroom on his return. He mounted the
stairs singing to himself,</p>

<p class="song">
"Que nous mangerons Marott-e,<br />
Bec-&agrave;-bec et toi et moi,"
</p>

<p>till he came in to where Rosalind was sitting reading, with her
wonderful hair combed free&mdash;probably by Sally for a treat. Then he
asked his question rather suddenly, and it made her start.</p>

<p>"I was in the middle of my book, and you made me jump." He gave her
a kiss for apology. "What's the question? When did I read to you
about Mary and the fat boy? I couldn't say. I feel as if I had,
though."</p>

<p>"Was it out in the garden at K. Villa? It wasn't here." He usually
called Krakatoa "K." for working purposes.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 445 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"No, it certainty wasn't here. It must have been at home, only I
can't recollect when. Ask Sally."</p>

<p>"The kitten wasn't there."</p>

<p>"She would know, though. She always knows. She's not asleep yet ...
Sallykin!" The young person is on the other side of a mere wooden
partition, congenial to the architecture of Lobjoit's, and her reply
conveys the idea of a speaker in bed who hasn't moved to answer.</p>

<p>"What? Be quick. I'm going to sleep."</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry, chick. When was it I read to this man Mary and the
fat boy in 'Pickwick'?"</p>

<p>"How should I know? Not when I was there."</p>

<p>"All right, Sarah." Thus Fenwick, to whom Sarah responds:</p>

<p>"Good-night, Jeremiah. Go to bed, and don't keep decent Christian
people awake at this hour of the night. Take mother's book away, and
cut it."</p>

<p>Rosalind closes her book and says: "<i>I</i> don't know, darling, if
Sally doesn't. Why do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't say. It crossed my mind. I know the kitten wasn't there,
though. Good-night, love.... Oh yes, I shall sleep to-night. Ta, ta,
Sarah&mdash;pleasant dreams!"</p>

<p>But he had not reached the door when the voice of Sarah came again,
with the implication of a mouth that had come out into the open.</p>

<p>"Stop, Jeremiah!" it said. "It wasn't at K. Villa."</p>

<p>"Why not, chick?"</p>

<p>"Because Pickwick's <i>lost</i>! It was lent to those impossible people
at Turnham Green, and they stole it. I know they did. Name like
Marylebone."</p>

<p>"The Haliburtons? Why, that's ever so long ago." Thus Rosalind.</p>

<p>"Of course it is. It's been gone ages. I'm going to sleep.
Good-night!" And Jeremiah said good-night once more and departed.</p>

<p>Sally didn't go straight to sleep, but she made a start on her way
there. It was not a vigorous start, for she had hardly begun upon it
when she desisted, and sat up in bed and listened.</p>

<p>"What's that, mother? Nothing wrong, is there?"</p>

<p>"No, darling child, what should be wrong? Go to sleep."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 446 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"I thought I heard you gasp, or snuffle, or sigh, or sob, or click
in your throat. That's all. Sure you didn't?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. Now, do be a reasonable kitten, and go to sleep; I
shall be in bed in half-a-second."</p>

<p>And Sally subsides, but first makes a stipulation: "You <i>will</i> sleep
in your hair, mother darling, won't you? Or, at least, do it up, and
not that hateful nightcap?"</p>

<p>But though Rosalind felt conscientiously able to disclaim any of the
sounds Sally had described, something audible had occurred in her
breathing. Sally's first word had gone nearest, but it was hardly a
full-grown gasp.</p>

<p>Her husband's question about "Pickwick" had scarcely taken her
attention off an exciting story-climax, and she really did want to
know why the Archbishop turned pale as death when the Countess
kissed him. Gerry was looking well and cheerful again, and there was
nothing to connect his inquiry with any reminiscence of "B.C." So,
as soon as he had gone, she reopened her book&mdash;not without a mental
allusion to a dog in Proverbs&mdash;and went on where she had left off.
The writer had not known how to manage his Archbishop and Countess,
and the story went flat and slushy like an ill-whipped <i>zabajone</i>.
She put the book aside, and wondered whether "Pickwick" really <i>had</i>
been alienated by the impossible Haliburtons; sat thinking, but only
of the thing of <i>now</i>&mdash;nothing of buried records.</p>

<p>So she sat, it might be for two minutes. Then, quite suddenly, she
had bitten her lip and her brows had wrinkled. And her eyes had
locked to a fixed look that would stay till she had thought this
out. So her face said, and the stillness of her hand.</p>

<p>For she had suddenly remembered when and where it was she had read
to that man about Mary and the fat boy. It was in the garden at her
mother's twenty-two years ago. She remembered it well now, and quite
suddenly. She could remember how Gerry, young-man-wise, had tried to
utilise Thackeray to show his greater knowledge of the world&mdash;had
flaunted Piccadilly and Pall Mall before the dazzled eyes of an
astonished suburban. She could remember how she read it aloud to
him, because, when he read over her shoulder, she always turned the
page before he was ready. And his decision that Dickens's characters
were never gentlemen, and her saying perhaps that was why he was so
amusing.

<!-- Page 447 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
And then how he got the book from her and went on reading
while she went away for her lawn-tennis shoes, and when she came
back found he had only two more pages to read, and then he would
come and play.</p>

<p>But it spoke well for her husband's chances of a quiet time to-night
that he should hold this memory in his mind, and yet be secure
against a complete resurrection of the past. Nothing else might grow
from it. He evidently thought the reading had been at Shepherd's
Bush. He would hardly have said, "the kitten wasn't there," unless
his ideas had been glued to that spot. But then&mdash;and Rosalind's mind
swam to think of it&mdash;how very decisively the kitten was "not there"
in that other garden two-and-twenty years ago.</p>

<p>It was at that moment the gasp, or sigh, or sob, or whatever it was,
awoke Sally. Her mother had been strong against the mere memory of
the happy hour of thoughtless long ago; but then, this that was to
come&mdash;this thing the time was thoughtless of! Was it not enough to
force a gasp from self-control itself? a cry from any creature
claiming to be human? "<i>The kitten wasn't there!</i>" No, truly she was
not.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>

<p class="subhead">HOW MEMORY CREPT BACK AND BACK, AND FENWICK KEPT HIS OWN COUNSEL.
ROSALIND NEED NEVER KNOW IT. OF A JOLLY BIG BLOB OF MELTED CANDLE,
AND SALLY'S HALF-BROTHER. OF FENWICK'S IMPROVED GOOD SPIRITS</p>

<p>That was a day of many little incidents, and a fine day into the
bargain. Perhaps the next day was helped to be a flat day by the
barometer, which had shown its usual untrustworthiness and gone
down. The wind's grievance&mdash;very perceptible to the leeward of
keyholes and window-cracks&mdash;may have been against this instability.
It had been looking forward to a day's rest, and here this
meteorology must needs be fussing. Neptune on the contrary was all
the fresher for his half-holiday, and was trotting out tiny white
ponies all over his fields, who played bo-peep with each other in
and out of the valleys of the plough-land. But they were grey
valleys now, that yesterday were smiling in the sun. And the sky was
a mere self-coloured sky (a modern expression, as unconvincing as
most of its congeners), and wanted to make everything else as grey
as itself. Also there came drifts of fine rain that wetted you
through, and your umbrella wasn't any good. So a great many of the
visitors to St.&nbsp;Sennans thought they would stop at home and get
those letters written.</p>

<p>Sally wouldn't admit that the day was flat <i>per se</i>, but only that
it had become so owing to the departure of L&aelig;titia and her husband.
She reviewed the latter a good deal, as one who had recently been
well under inspection and had stood the test. He was really a very
nice fellow, haberdasher or no, wasn't he, mother? To which Rosalind
replied that he was a very nice fellow indeed, only so quiet. If he
had had his violin with him, he would have been much more
perceptible. But she supposed it was best to travel with it as
little as possible. For it had been decided, all things considered,
that the precious Strad should be left locked up at home. "It's got
an insurance policy all to itself,"

<!-- Page 449 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
said Sally, "for three hundred
pounds." She was quite awestruck by the three hundred golden
sovereigns which these pounds would have been if they had had an
existence of their own off paper.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> ought to have an insurance policy all to yourself, Sarah,"
said Fenwick. "Only I don't believe any office would accept you.
Fancy your swimming out like that yesterday! How far did you go?"</p>

<p>"Round the buoy and aback again. I say, Jeremiah, if ever I get
drowned, mind you rush to the bathing-machine and see if there's a
copy of 'Ally Sloper' or 'Tit-Bits'. Because there'd be fifty pounds
for each. Think of that!" Sally is delighted with these sums, too,
to the extent of quite losing sight of the sacrifice necessary for
their acquisition.</p>

<p>"Two whole fifties!" Fenwick says, adding after consideration: "I
think we had sooner keep our daughter, eh, Rosey?" And Rosalind
agreed. Only she really was a shocking madcap, the kitten!</p>

<p>Had some flavour of Fenwick's mental history got in the air, that
Sally, presumably with no direct information about its last chapter,
should say to him suddenly: "It <i>is</i> such a puzzle to me, Jeremiah,
that you've never recollected the railway-carriage"? He was saved
from telling fibs in reply&mdash;for he <i>had</i> recollected the
railway-carriage, and left it, as it were, for Mr.&nbsp;Harrisson&mdash;by
Sally continuing: "When you were Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick, and I wasn't at
liberty to kiss you." She did so to illustrate.</p>

<p>"I don't see how I could reasonably have resented your kissing me,
Sarah. And I'm Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick now."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, you're Jeremiah. But if you were he ever so, I'm
puzzled why Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick <i>now</i> can't remember Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick <i>then</i>."</p>

<p>"He <i>can't</i>, Sarah dear. He can no more remember Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick <i>then</i>
than if no such person had ever existed." It was a clever
equivocation, for though he had so far made nothing of the name on
his arm, he was quite clear he came back to England Harrisson. His
gravity and sadness as he said it may have been not so much
duplicity as a reflection from his turgid current of thought of the
last two days. It imposed on Sally, who decided in her own mind on
changing the topic as soon as she

<!-- Page 450 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
could do it without a jerk.
Meanwhile, a stepping-stone was available&mdash;extravagant treatment of
the subject with a view to help from laughter.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick <i>then</i> would have thought if I had kissed
him in the railway-carriage."</p>

<p>"He'd have thought you must be Sally, only he hadn't noticed it.
<i>He</i> wouldn't have made a rumpus on high moral grounds, I'm sure.
But I don't know about the old cock that talked about the terms of
the Company's charter...."</p>

<p>"Hullo!" Sally interrupts him blankly. He had better have let it
alone. But it wouldn't do to admit anything.</p>

<p>"What's 'hullo,' Sarah?"</p>

<p>"See how you're recollecting things! Jeremiah's recollecting the
railway-carriage, mother&mdash;the electrocution-carriage."</p>

<p>"Are you, darling?" Rosalind, coming behind his chair, puts her
hands round his neck. "What have you recollected?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I've recollected anything the kitten hasn't told me,"
says Fenwick dreamily. But Sally is positive she never told him
anything about the terms of the Company's charter.</p>

<p>Rosalind adheres to her policy of keeping Sally out of it as much as
possible. In this case a very small fib indeed serves the purpose:
"You must have told him, chick; or perhaps I repeated it. I remember
your telling <i>me</i> about the elderly gentleman who was in a rage with
the Company." Sally looked doubtful, but gave up the point.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Fenwick felt certain in his own heart that "the terms
of the Company's charter" was a bit of private recollection of his
own. And Rosalind had never heard of it before. But it was true she
had heard of the elderly gentleman. Near enough!</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>As to the crowd of memories that kept coming, some absolutely clear,
some mere phantoms, into the arena of Fenwick's still disordered
mind, they would have an interest, and a strong one, for this story
if its object were the examination of strange freaks of memory. But
the only point we are nearly concerned with is the rigid barrier
drawn across the backward pathway of his recollection at some period
between ten and fifteen years ago. Till this should be removed, and
the dim image of his forgotten marriage should acquire force and
cohesion, he and his wife were safe

<!-- Page 451 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
from the intrusion of their
former selves on the scene of their present happiness&mdash;safe possibly
from a power of interference it might exercise for ill&mdash;safe
certainly from risk of a revelation to Sally of her mother's history
and her own parentage&mdash;but safe at a heavy cost to the one of the
three who alone now held the key to their disclosure.</p>

<p>However vividly Fenwick had recalled the incidents of his arrival in
England, and however convinced he was that no part of them was mere
dream, they all belonged for him to that buried Harrisson whose
identity he shrank from taking on himself&mdash;<i>would</i> have shrunk from,
at the cost that was to be paid for it, had the prize of its
inheritance been ten times as great. Still, one or two connecting
links had caught on either side, the chief one being Sally, who had
actually spoken with him whilst still Harrisson&mdash;although it must be
admitted she had not kissed him&mdash;and the one next in importance, the
cabman. The pawnbroker made a very bad third&mdash;in fact, scarcely
counted, owing to his own moroseness or reserve. But the cabman!
Why, Fenwick had it all now at his fingers' ends. He could recall
the start from New York, the wish to keep the secret of his
gold-mining success to himself on the ship, and his satisfaction
when he found his name printed with one <i>s</i> in the list of cabin
passengers. Then a pleasant voyage on a summer Atlantic, and that
nice young American couple whose acquaintance he made before they
passed Sandy Hook, every penny of whose cash had been stolen on
board, and how he had financed them, careless of his own ready cash.
And how then, not being sure if he should go to London or to
Manchester, he decided on the former, and wired his New York banker
to send him credit, prompt, at the bank he named in London; and then
Livermore's Rents, 1808, and the joy of the cabman; and then the
Twopenny Tube; and then Sally. He tried what he could towards
putting in order what followed, but could determine nothing except
that he stooped for the half-crown, and something struck him a heavy
blow. Thereupon he was immediately a person, or a confusion, sitting
alone in a cab, to whom a lady came whom he thought he knew, and to
this lady he wanted to say, "Is that you?" for no reason he could
now trace, but found he could scarcely articulate.</p>

<p>Recalling everything thus, to the full, he was able to supply links

<!-- Page 452 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
in the story that we have found no place for so far. For instance,
the loss of a small valise on the boat that contained credentials
that would have made it quite unnecessary for him to cable to New
York for credit, and also an incident this reminded him of&mdash;that he
had not only parted with most of his cash to the young Americans,
but had given his purse to the lady to keep her share of it in,
saying he had a very good cash pocket, and would have plenty of time
to buy another, whereas <i>they</i> were hurrying through to catch the
tidal boat for Calais. This accounted for that little new
pocket-book without a card in it that had given no information at
all. He could remember having made so free with his cards on the
boat and in the train that he had only one left when he got to
Euston.</p>

<p>He found himself, as the hours passed, better and better able to
dream and speculate about the life he now chose to imagine was
Harrisson's property, not his; and the more so the more he felt the
force of the barrier drawn across the earlier part of it. Had the
barrier remained intact, he might ultimately have convinced himself,
for all practical purposes, that Harrisson's life was all dream.
Yes, all a dream! The cold and the gold of the Klondyke, the French
Canadians at Ontario, four years on a cattle-ranch in California,
five of unsuccessful attempts to practise at the American Bar&mdash;all,
all a dream of another man named Harrisson, dreamed by Algernon
Fenwick, that big hairy man at the wine-merchant's in Bishopsgate,
who has a beautiful wife and a daughter who swims like a fish. One
of the many might-have-beens that were not! But a decision against
its reality demanded time, and his revival of memory was only
forty-eight hours old so far.</p>

<p>Of course, he would have liked, of all things, to make full
confession, and talk it all out&mdash;this quasi-dream&mdash;to Rosalind; but
he could not be sure how much he could safely bring to light, how
much would be best concealed. He could not run the <i>slightest</i> risk
when the thing at stake was her peace of mind. No, no&mdash;Harrisson be
hanged! Him and his money, too.</p>

<p>So, though things kept coming to his recollection, he could hold his
peace, and did so. There was nothing to come&mdash;not likely to be&mdash;that
could unsay that revelation that he had been a married man, and did
not know of his wife's death; not even that

<!-- Page 453 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
he and she had been
divorced, which would have been nearly as bad. He knew the worst of
it, at any rate, and Rosalind need never know it if he kept it all
to himself, best and worst.</p>

<p>So that day passed, and there was nothing to note about it, unless
we mention that Sally was actually kept out of the Channel by
Neptune's little white ponies aforesaid, which spoiled the swimming
water&mdash;though, of course, it wasn't rough&mdash;backed by the fact that
these little sudden showers wetted you through, right through your
waterproof, before you knew where you were. Dr.&nbsp;Conrad came in as
usual in the evening, reporting that his mother was "rather better."
It was a discouraging habit she had, when she was not known to have
been any worse than usual. This good lady always caught
Commiseration napping, if ever that quality took forty winks. The
doctor was very silent this evening, imbibing Sally without comment.
However, St.&nbsp;Sennans was drawing to a close for all others. That was
enough to account for it, Sally thought. It was the last day but
one, and poor Prosy couldn't be expected to accept her own
view&mdash;that the awful jolliness of being back at Krakatoa Villa would
even compensate&mdash;more than compensate&mdash;for the pangs of parting with
the Saint. Sally's optimism was made of a stuff that would wash, or
was all wool.</p>

<p>According to her own account, she had spent the whole day wondering
whether the battle between Tishy and her mother had come off. She
said so last thing of all to <i>her</i> mother as she decanted the melted
paraffin of a bedroom candle whose wick, up to its neck therein, was
unable to find a scope for its genius, and yielded only a spectral
blue spark that went out directly if you carried it. Tilted over, it
would lick in the end&mdash;this was Sally's testimony; and if you
dropped the grease on the back of the soap-dish and thickened it up
to a good blob, it would come off click when it was cold, and not
make any mess at all.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been wondering all day long," said she. "How I should
enjoy being there to see! How freezing and dignified the Dragon will
be! Mrs.&nbsp;Sales Wilson! Or perhaps she'll flare. (I wish this wick
would; and it's such disgraceful waste of good candle!)"</p>

<p>"I do think, kitten, you're unkind to the poor lady. Just think how
she must have dreamed about the splendid match her handsome

<!-- Page 454 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
daughter was going to make! And, you know, it <i>is</i> rather a come
down...."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course it's a come down. But I don't pity the Dragon one
bit. She should have thought more of Tishy's happiness, and less of
her grandeur. (It's just beginning; the flame will go white
directly.)"</p>

<p>"She'd got some one else in view then?" Rosalind was quickly
perceptive about it.</p>

<p>"Oh yes; don't you know? Sir Penderfield. (That'll do now, nicely;
there's the white flame!) Sir Oughtred Penderfield. He's a Bart., of
course. But he's a horror, and they say his father was even worse.
Like father, like son! And the Dragon wanted Tishy to accept him."</p>

<p>At the name Rosalind shivered. The thought that followed it sent a
knife-cut to her heart. This man that Sally had spoken of so
unconsciously was <i>her brother</i>&mdash;at least, he was brother enough to
her by blood to make that thought a blade to penetrate the core of
her mother's soul. It was a case for her strength to show itself
in&mdash;a case for nettle-grasping with a vengeance. She would grasp
this nettle directly; but oh, for one moment&mdash;only one moment&mdash;just
to be a little less sick with the slice of the chill steel! just to
quench the tremor she knew would come with her voice if she tried
now to say, "What was the name? Tishy's <i>pr&eacute;tendu</i>'s, I mean; not
his father's."</p>

<p>But she could take the whole of a moment, and another, for that
matter. So she left her words on her tongue's tip to say later, and
felt secure that Sally would not look up and see the dumb white face
she herself could see in the mirror she sat before. For, of course,
she saw Sally's reflection, too, its still thoughtful eyelids half
shrouded in a broken coil of black hair their owner's pearly teeth
are detaining an end of, to stop it falling in the paraffin she is
so intent on, as she watches it cooling on the soap-dish.</p>

<p>"I've made it such a jolly big blob it'll take ever so long to cool.
You can, you know, if you go gently. Only then the middle stops
soft, and if you get in a hurry it spoils the clicket." But it is
hard enough now to risk moving the hair over it, and Sally's voice
was free to speak as soon as her little white hand had swept the
black coils back beyond the round white throat. Mrs.

<!-- Page 455 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
Lobjoit's
mirror has its defects apart from some of the quicksilver having
been scratched off; but Rosalind can see the merpussy's image plain
enough, and knows perfectly well that before she looks up she will
reap the harvest of happiness she has been looking forward to. She
will "clicket" off the "blob" with her finger.</p>

<p>The moment of fruition comes, and a filbert thumbnail spuds the
hardened lozenge off the smooth glaze. "There!" says Sally, "didn't
I tell you? Just like ice.... What, mother?" For her mother's
question had been asked, very slightly varied, in a nettle-grasping
sense. She has had time to think.</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> was Tishy's man's name&mdash;the other applicant? Christian name,
I mean; not his father's."</p>

<p>"Sir Oughtred Penderfield. Why?"</p>

<p>"I remember there was a small boy in India, twenty-two years ago,
named Penderfield. Is Oughtred his only name?" The nettle-grasping
there was in this! Rosalind felt consoled by her own strength.</p>

<p>"Can't say. He may have a dozen. Never seen him. Don't want to! But
his hair's as black as mine, Tishy says.... I say, mother, isn't it
deliciously smooth?" But this refers to the paraffin lozenge, not to
the hair.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling. Now I want to get to bed, if you've no objection."</p>

<p>"Certainly, mother darling; but say I'm right about the Dragon and
Sir Penderfield. Because I <i>am</i>, you know."</p>

<p>"Of course you are, chick. Only you never told me about him; now,
did you?"</p>

<p>"Because I was so honourable. It was a secret. Very well,
good-night, then.... Oh, you poor mother! how cold you are, and I've
been keeping you up! Good-night!"</p>

<p>And off went Sally, leaving her mother to reason with herself about
her own unreasonableness. After all, what was there in the fact that
the little chap she remembered, seven years old, at the Residency at
Khopal twenty odd years ago had grown up and inherited his father's
baronetcy? What was there in this to discompose and upset her, to
make her breath catch and her nerves thrill? A longing came on her
that Gerry should not look in to say good-night till she was in a
position to refuse interviewing

<!-- Page 456 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
on the score of impending sleep.
She made a dash for bed, and got the light out, out-generalling him
by perhaps a minute.</p>

<p>What could she expect? Not that little Tamerlane, as his father
called him, should die just to be out of her path. It was no fault
of his that he was his father's son, with&mdash;how could she doubt after
what Sally had just said?&mdash;the curse of his father's form of manhood
or beasthood upon him. And yet, might it not have been better that
he should have died, the innocent child she knew him, than live to
follow his father's footsteps? Better, best of all that the whole
evil brood should perish and be forgotten.... Stop!</p>

<p>For the thought she had framed caught her breath and held it, caught
her by the heart and checked its beating, caught her by the brain
and stopped its thinking; and she was glad when her husband's voice
found her, dumb and stunned in the silence, and brought a respite to
the unanswerable enigma she was face to face with.</p>

<p>"Hullo! light out already? Beg your pardon, darling. Good-night!"</p>

<p>"I wasn't asleep." So he came in and said good-night officially and
departed. His voice and his presence had staved off a nightmare idea
that was on the watch to seize on her&mdash;how if chance had brought
Sally across this unsuspected relation of hers, and events had
forced a full declaration of their kinship? Somnus jumped at the
chance given by its frustration; the sea air asserted itself, and
went into partnership with him, and Rosalind's mind was carried
captive into dreamland.</p>

<p>But not before she had heard her husband stop singing to himself a
German student's song as he closed his door on himself for the
night.</p>

<p class="song">
"War ich zum grossen Herrn geboren, wie Kaiser Maximilian...."
</p>

<p>There could be no further unwelcome memories there, thank Heaven! No
mind oppressed by them could possibly sing "Kram-bam-bambuli,
krambam-bu-li!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL"></a>CHAPTER XL</h2>

<p class="subhead">BATHING WEATHER AGAIN, AND A LETTER FROM TISHY BRADSHAW. THE TRIUMPH
OF ORPHEUS. BUT WAS IT EURYDICE OR THE LITTLE BATTERY? THE
REV.&nbsp;MR.&nbsp;HERRICK. OF A REVERIE UNDER A BATHING-MACHINE, AND OF GWENDOLEN'S
MAMMA'S CONNECTING-LINK. OF DR. CONRAD'S MAMMA'S DONKEY-CHAIR, AND
HIS GREAT-AUNT ELIZA. HOW SALLY AND HE STARTED FOR THEIR LAST WALK
AT ST.&nbsp;SENNANS</p>

<p>The next day the morning was bright and the sea was clear of
Poseidon's ponies. They had gone somewhere else. Therefore, it
behooved Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit to get breakfast quick, because it was absurd
to expect anybody to go in directly after, and the water wouldn't be
good later than half-past ten. Which Sally, coming downstairs at
eight, impressed on Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit, who entered her own recognisances
that it should appear as by magic the very minute your mamma came
down. For it is one of the pleasures of
anticipation-of-a-joy-to-come to bring about its antecedents too
soon, and so procure a blank period of unqualified existence to
indulge Hope in without alloy. Even so, when true prudence wishes to
catch a train, she orders her cab an hour before, and takes tickets
twenty minutes before, and arrives on the platform eighteen minutes
before there is the slightest necessity to do so; and then she
stands on the said platform and lives for the train that is to be,
and inquires of every guard, ticket-taker, and pointsman with
respect to every linear yard of the platform edge, whether her train
is going to come up there; and they ask each other questions, and
give prismatic information; and then the train for Paradise (let us
say) comes reluctantly backwards into the station with friends
standing on its margin, and prudence seizes her valise and goes at a
hand-gallop to the other end, where the <i>n</i>th class is, and is only
just in time to get a corner seat.</p>

<p>So, though there was no fear of the tide going out as fast as the
train for Paradise, Sally, relying on Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit, who had become a
very old friend in eight weeks, felt she had done well to

<!-- Page 458 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
be beforehand, and, as breakfast would be twenty minutes, sat down to
write a letter to Tishy. She wrote epistle-wise, heedless of style
and stops, and as her mother was also twenty minutes&mdash;we are not
responsible for these expressions&mdash;she wrote a heap of it. Then
events thickened, as Fenwick, returning from an early dip, met the
postman outside, and came in bearing an expected letter which Sally
pounced upon.</p>

<p>"All about the row!" said she, attacking an impregnable corner of
the envelope with a fork-point, in a fever of impatience to get at
the contents. "Hang these envelopes! There, that's done it! Whatever
they want to sticky them up so for I can't imagine...."</p>

<p>"Get your breakfast, kitten, and read it after."</p>

<p>"I dare say. Catch me! No, I'm the sort that never waits for
anything.... No, mummy darling; it shan't get cold. I can gormandize
and read aloud both at once."</p>

<p>But she doesn't keep her promise, for she dives straight into an
exploration ahead, and meanly says, "Just half a minute till I see
what's coming," or, "Only to the end of this sentence," and also
looks very keen and animated, and throws in short notes of
exclamation and <i>well</i>'s and <i>there</i>'s and <i>think of that</i>'s till
Fenwick enters a protest.</p>

<p>"Don't cheat, Sarah!" he says. "Play fair! If you won't read it
aloud yourself, let somebody else."</p>

<p>"There's the first sheet to keep you quiet, Jeremiah!" Who, however,
throws it over to Rosalind, who throws it back with a laugh.</p>

<p>"What a couple of big babies you two are!" she exclaims. "As if I
couldn't possess my soul in peace for five minutes! Do put the
letter by till you've had your breakfasts."</p>

<p>But this course was not approved, and the contents of L&aelig;titia's
epistle came out by fits and jerks and starts, and may be said to
have been mixed with tea and coffee and eggs and bacon and toast.
Perhaps we had better leave these out, and give the letter intact.
Here it is:</p>

<div class="corresp">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Sally</span>,</p>

<p>"I am going to keep my promise, and write you a long letter at once,
and tell you all about our reception at home. You will say

<!-- Page 459 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
it wasn't worth writing, especially as you will be back on Monday.
However, a promise is a promise!</p>

<p>"We got to Victoria at seven, and were not so very late considering
at G. Terrace; but when we had had something to eat I propounded my
idea I told you of, that we should just go straight on, and beard
mamma in her own den, and have it out. I knew I shouldn't sleep
unless we did. Paggy said, 'Wouldn't it do as well if he called
there to-morrow for the Strad&mdash;which we had left behind last time as
a connecting-link to go and fetch away&mdash;and me to meet him as he
came from the shop?' But surprise-tactics were better&mdash;I knew they
would be&mdash;and now Paggy admits I was right.</p>

<p>"Of course, Thomas stared when he saw who it was, and was going to
sneak off without announcing us, and Fossett, who just crossed us in
the passage, was perfectly comic. Pag said afterwards she was
bubbling over with undemonstrativeness, which was clever for him. I
simply said to Thomas that I thought he had better announce us, as
we weren't expected, and he asked who he was to announce, miss!
Actually, I was rather relieved when Pag said, 'Say Mr.&nbsp;and Mrs.
Julius Bradshaw.' I should have laughed, I know. Thomas looked a
model of discretion that wouldn't commit itself either way, and did
as he was bid in an apologetic voice; but he turned round on the
stairs to say to me, 'I suppose you know, msam, there's two ladies
and a gentleman been dining here?' Because he began miss and ended
ma'am, and then turned scarlet. Pag said after he thought Thomas
wanted to caution us against a bigamist mamma was harbouring.</p>

<p>"Papa was very nice, really. His allusion to our little escapade was
the only one made, and might have meant nothing at all. 'Well,
you're a nice couple of people, upon my word!' and then, seeing that
mamma remained a block (which she can), he introduced Paggy to one
of the two ladies as 'My son-in-law, Mr.&nbsp;Julius Bradshaw.' I'm sure
mamma gave a wooden snort and was ashamed of it before visitors,
because she did another rather more probable one directly after, and
pretended it was only that sort. Really, except a peck for me and
saying <i>howd</i> and nothing more to Paggy, she kept herself to
herself. But it didn't matter, because of what happened. Really, it
quite made me jump&mdash;I

<!-- Page 460 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
mean the way the lady Pag was introduced to
rushed into his arms. I wasn't sure I hadn't better take him away at
once. She was a celebrated German pianiste that had accompanied him
in Paris. Mamma was at school with her at Frankfort. She had been
inconsolable at the disappearance of the great Carissimi, whose
playing of the Kreutzer was the only perfectly sympathetic one she
had ever met. Was she never to play it with him again? Alas, no! for
she was off to Vienna to-morrow, and then to New York, and if the
ship went down she would never play the Kreutzer with Signore
Carissimi again!</p>

<p>"I saw papa's eye looking mischievous, and then he pointed to the
Strad, where it was lying on the piano&mdash;locked up safe; we saw to
that&mdash;and said there was Paganini's fiddle, why not play the
<i>Cruet-stand</i>, or whatever you called it, <i>now</i>? Mamma found her
voice, but lost her judgment, for she tried to block the performance
on a fibby ground. Think how late it was, and how it would be
keeping Madame von H&ouml;fenhoffer! She put her head in the lion's mouth
there, for the Frau immediately said she would play all night rather
than lose a note of Signore Carissimi. The other two went, and
nobody wanted them. I've forgotten the woman's second husband's
name&mdash;he's dead&mdash;but her son's the man I told you about. Of course,
he hadn't expected to meet me, and I hope he felt like a fool. I was
so glad it wasn't him, but Paggy. They played right through the
Kreutzer, and didn't want the music, which couldn't be found, and
then did bits again, and it was absolutely glorious. Even mamma
(she's fond of music&mdash;it's her only good quality&mdash;and where should I
get mine from if she wasn't?) couldn't stop quite stony, though she
did her best, I promise you. As for papa, he was chuckling so over
mamma's dilemma&mdash;because she wanted to trample on Paggy, and it
<i>was</i> a dilemma&mdash;that he didn't care how long it went on. And do you
know, dear, it <i>did</i> go on&mdash;one thing after another, that Frau glued
to the clavier like a limpet not detachable without violence&mdash;till
nearly one in the morning, having begun at ten about! And there was
papa and Egerton and Theeny all sniggering at mamma, I know, in
secret, and really proud of the connexion, if the truth were known.
Mamma tried to get a little revenge by saying to me freezingly when
the H&ouml;fenhoffer had gone: 'I suppose you are going home with

<!-- Page 461 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
Mr.&nbsp;Bradshaw, L&aelig;titia? Good-night.' And then she said <i>goodn</i> to Paggy
just as she had said <i>howd</i>. I thought Paggy behaved so nicely.
However, I'll tell you all about that on Monday.</p>

<p>"Papa was <i>very</i> nice&mdash;came out on the doorstep to say good-night,
and, do you know&mdash;it really <i>is</i> very odd; it must be the sea
air&mdash;papa said to Paggy as we were starting: 'How's the head&mdash;the
nerves, you know&mdash;eh, Master Julius?' And actually Paggy said: 'Why,
God bless my soul, I had forgotten all about them!' Oh, Sally
darling, just think! Suppose they got well, and all because I
treated him to a honeymoon! Oh, my gracious, what a long letter!"</p>
</div>

<p>"There now! that <i>is</i> a letter and a half. 'With love from us both,'
mine affectionately. And twelve pages! And Tishy's hand's not so
large, neither, as all that." This is Sally, as epilogue; but her
mother puts in a correction:</p>

<p>"It's thirteen pages. There's a bit on a loose page you haven't
read." Sally has seen that, and it was nothing&mdash;so she says; but
Fenwick picks it up and reads it aloud:</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Just a line to say I've remembered that name. She's
Herrick&mdash;married a parson in India soon after her Penderfield
husband died. She's great on reformatories."</p>

<p>Sally reread her letter with a glow of interest on her face and a
passing approval or echo now and then. She noticed nothing unusual
in either her mother or her stepfather; but she did not look up, so
absorbed was she.</p>

<p>Had she done so she might have wondered why her mother had gone so
pale suddenly, and why there should be that puzzled absent look on
the handsome face her eyes remained fixed on across the table; but
her own mind was far away, deep in her amusement at her friend's
letter, full of her image of the disconcerted Dragon and the way
Paganini and Beethoven in alliance had ridden rough-shod over Mrs.
Grundy and social distinctions. She saw nothing, and finished a cup
of coffee undisturbed, and asked for more.</p>

<p>Fenwick, caught by some memory or association he could not define or
give its place to, for the moment looked at neither of his
companions. Rosalind, only too clear about all the postscript of the
letter had brought before her own mind, saw reason to

<!-- Page 462 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
dread its
effect on his. The linking of the name of Penderfield and that of
the clergyman who had married them at Umballa&mdash;a name that, two days
since, had had a familiar sound to him when she incautiously uttered
it&mdash;was using Suggestion to bait a trap for Memory. She felt she was
steering through shoal-waters perilously near the wind; but she made
no attempt to break his reverie. She might do as much harm as good.
She only watched his face, feeling its contrast to that of the
absorbed and happy merpussy, rejoicing in the fortunate outcome of
her friend's anxieties.</p>

<p>It was a great relief when, with a deep breath and a shake, akin to
a horse's when the flies won't take a hint, Fenwick flung off the
oppression, whatever it was, and came back into the living world on
a stepping-stone of the back-talk.</p>

<p>"Well done, Paganini! Nothing like it since Orpheus and
Eurydice&mdash;only this time it was Proserpine, not Pluto, that had to
be put to sleep.... What's the matter, darling? Anything wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. I was looking at you."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I'm</i> all right!" And Sally looked up from her letter for a
moment to say, "There's nothing the matter with Jeremiah," and went
on reading as before. Sally's attitude about him always implied a
kind of proprietorship, as in a large, fairly well-behaved dog.
Rosalind felt glad she had not looked at <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>Presently Fenwick said: "Now, who's coming for a walk with me?" But
Sally was off directly to find the Swiss girl she sometimes bathed
with, and Rosalind thought it would be nice in a sheltered place on
the beach. She really wanted to be alone, and knew the shortest way
to this was to sit still, especially in the morning; but Gerry had
better get Vereker to go for a walk. Perhaps she would look in at
his mother's later. So Fenwick, after a customary caution to Sally
not to drown herself, went away to find Conrad, as he generally
called him now.</p>

<p>Rosalind was shirking a problem she dared not face from a cowardly
conviction of its insolubility. What would she do if Gerry should,
without some warning, identify her? She had to confess to herself
that she had no clue at all to the effect it would have, coming
suddenly, on him. She could at least imagine aspects, attitudes,
tones of voice for him if it came slowly; but she

<!-- Page 463 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
could not supply
any image of him, under other circumstances, not more or less
founded on her recollections of twenty years ago. Might she not lose
him again, as she lost him then? She <i>must</i> get nearer to safety
than she was now. Was she not relying on the house not catching fire
instead of negotiating insurance policies or providing fire
extinguishers?</p>

<p>She would go and sit under the shelter of one of the many unemployed
machines&mdash;for only a few daring spirits would follow Sally's example
to-day&mdash;and try to think it out. Just a few instructions to Mrs.
Lobjoit, and a word or two of caution to Gerry not to fall over
cliffs, or to get run over at level-crossings or get sunstrokes, or
get cold, etc., and she would fall back on her own society and
think....</p>

<p>Yes, that was the question! Might she not lose him again? And if she
did, how live without him?... Oh yes, she would be no worse off than
before, in a certain sense. She would have Sally still ... but....</p>

<p>Which would be the worse? The loss of the husband whom every day
taught her to love more dearly, or the task of explaining the cause
of her loss to Sally? The one she fixed her mind on always seemed
intolerable. As for the other contingencies&mdash;difficulties of making
all clear to friends, and so forth&mdash;let them go; they were not worth
a thought. But she <i>must</i> be beforehand, and know how to act, how to
do her best to avert both, if the thing she dreaded came to pass....</p>

<p>There now! Here she was settled under the lee of a machine&mdash;happily
the shadow-side, for the sun was warm&mdash;and the white foam of the
undertow was guilty of a tremendous glare&mdash;the one the people who
can't endure the seaside get neuralgia from&mdash;and Sally was going to
come out of the second machine directly in the Turkey-twill
knickers, and find her way through the selvage-wave and the dazzle,
or get knocked down and have to try back. Surely Rosalind, instead
of saying over and over again that she <i>must</i> be ready to meet the
coming evil, possibly close at hand, ought to make a serious effort
to become so. She found herself, even at this early hour of the day,
tired with the strain of a misgiving that an earthquake was
approaching; and as those who have lived through earthquakes become
unstrung at every slightest tremor of the earth's crust beneath
them, so she felt that

<!-- Page 464 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
the tension begun with that recurrence of
two days ago had grown and grown, and threatened to dominate her
mind, to the exclusion of all else. Every little thing, such as the
look on her husband's face half an hour ago, made her say to
herself, as the earthquake-haunted man says at odd times all through
the day and night, "Is this <i>it</i>? Has it come?" and she saw before
her no haven of peace.</p>

<p>What was it now she really most feared? Simply the effect of the
revelation on her husband's mind&mdash;an effect no human creature could
make terms with. She was not the least afraid of anything he could
say or do, delirium apart; but see what delirium had made of
him&mdash;she was sure it was so&mdash;in that old evil hour when he had flung
her from him and gone away in anger to try to get her sentence of
banishment ratified. How could she guard against a repetition, in
some form or other, of the disastrous errors of that unhappy time?</p>

<p>As we know, she was still in ignorance of all the revived memories
he had told to Vereker; but she knew there had been
something&mdash;disjointed, perhaps, and not to be relied on, as the
doctor had said, but none the less to be feared on that account. She
had seen the effect of his sleepless night before he went away with
Vereker, and knew it to be connected with mental disturbance outside
and beyond mere loss of rest; and she had an uneasy sense that
something was being kept from her. She could not but believe Gerry's
cheerfulness was partly assumed. Had he been quite at ease about his
recollections, surely he would have told them to <i>her</i>. Then this
had all come on the top of that Kreutzkammer one. The most upsetting
thing of all, though, was the change that had come over him suddenly
at breakfast, just after he had read aloud the name Herrick&mdash;a name
he had seemed not free from memory of when her tongue was betrayed
into speaking it&mdash;and the name Penderfield. If it was due to this
last, so much the worse! It was the name of all others that was best
for oblivion.</p>

<p>How hard it seemed that it must needs force itself to the fore in
this way! Its present intrusion into her life and surroundings was
utterly unconnected with anything in the past. Sally's friendship
with L&aelig;titia began in a music-class six years ago. The Sales Wilsons
were people to all appearance as un-Indian as

<!-- Page 465 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
any folk need be. Why
must Sally's friend, of all others, be the object of its owner's
unwelcome admiration? To think, too, how near she had been to a
precipice without knowing it! Suppose she had come face to face with
that woman again! To be sure, her intercourse with Ladbroke Grove
Road was limited to one stiff exchange of calls in "the season."
Still, it might have happened ... but where was the use of begging
and borrowing troubles?</p>

<p>Was it, or was it not, the fact, she asked herself, that now, after
all these years, she thought of this woman as worse than her
husband, the iniquity of the accomplice as more diabolical than that
of the principal? She found she could not answer this in the
negative off-hand. The paradox was also before her that that
incorrigible amphibious treasure of hers, whose voice was even now
shouting to her more timorous friend from beyond the selvage-wave
she had just contemptuously dived through&mdash;that that Sally,
inexchangeable for anything she could conceive or imagine, must
needs have been something quite other than she was, had she come of
any other technical paternity than the accursed one she had to own
to. Was there some terrible law in Nature that slow forgiveness of
the greatest wrong that can be wrought must perforce be granted to
its inflictor, through the gracious survivor of a brutal
indifference that would almost add to his crime, if that were
possible? If, so, surely the Universe must be the work of an
Almighty Fiend, a Demiurgus with a cruel heart, and this the
masterstroke of all his cunning. But what, in Heaven's name, was the
use of bruising her brains against the conundrums of the great
unanswered metaphysical sphinx? Better be contented with the easy
vernacular solution of the rhymester:</p>

<p class="verse">
"Praise God from whom all blessings flow,<br />
Evils from circumstances grow."
</p>

<p>Because she felt she was getting no nearer the solution of her own
problem, and was, if anything, wandering from the point.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at the matter was beginning to take form: had
hung about her mind and forsaken it more than once. Might it not be
better, after all, to dash at the position and capture it while her
forces were well under control? To pursue the

<!-- Page 466 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
metaphor, the
commissariat might not hold out. Better endure the ills we have&mdash;of
course, Rosalind knew all that&mdash;than fly to others that we know not
of. But suppose we have a chance of flying to others we can measure
the length and breadth of, and staving off thereby an uncalculable
unknown? She felt she almost knew the worst that could come of
taking Gerry into her confidence, telling him boldly all about
himself, provided she could choose her opportunity and make sure
Sally was well out of the way. The concealment from Sally was the
achievement whose failure involved the greatest risk. Her husband's
mind would bear the knowledge of his story well or ill according to
the way in which it reached him; but the necessity of keeping her
girl in ignorance of it was a thing absolute. Any idea that Sally's
origin could be concealed from her, and her stepfather's identity
made known, Rosalind dismissed as simply fantastic.</p>

<p>A lady who had established herself below high-water mark with many
more books than she could read, and plant capable of turning out
much more work than she could do, at this point fled for safety from
a rush of white foam. It went back for more, meaning to wet her
through next time; but had to bear its disappointment. Mrs.
Arkwright&mdash;for it was Gwendolen's mamma&mdash;being driven from the
shadow of the breakwater, cast about her for a new lodgment, and
perceived one beside Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick, whom she thought very well for
the seaside, but not to leave cards on. <i>Might</i> she come up there,
beside you? Rosalind didn't want her, but had to pretend she did, to
encourage her advent. It left behind it a track of skeins and
volumes, which had trickled from the fugitive, but were recovered by
a domestic, and pronounced dry. Besides, they were only library
books, and didn't matter.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen you since the other day on the pier, Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick,
or I wanted to have asked you more about that charming young couple,
the Julian Attwoods. Oh dear! I knew I should get the name wrong....
<i>Bradshaw!</i> Yes, of course." Her vivid perception of what the name
really is, when apprised of it, almost amounts to a paroxysm. You
see, on the pier that day, she made a bad blunder over those
Bradshaw people, and though she had consoled her conscience by
admitting to her husband

<!-- Page 467 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
that she had "<i>mis le pied dans le plat</i>,"
still, she thought, if she was actually going to plump down on Mrs.
Fenwick's piece of beach, she ought to do a little more apology.
By-the-bye, why is it that ladies of her sort always resort to
snippets of French idiom, whenever they get involved in a quagmire
of delicacy&mdash;or indelicacy, as may be? Will Gwendolen grow like her
mother? However, that doesn't concern us now.</p>

<p>A little stiffness on Rosalind's part was really due to her wish to
be by herself, but Mrs.&nbsp;Arkwright ascribed it to treasured
resentment against her blunders of two days since. Now, she was a
person who could never let anything drop&mdash;a tugging person. She
proceeded to develop the subject.</p>

<p>"Really a most interesting story! I need hardly say that my
informants had given me no particulars. Very old friends of my
husband's. Quite possible they really knew nothing of this young
gentleman's musical gifts. Simply told my husband the tale as I told
it to you. Just that the daughter of an old friend of theirs,
Professor Sales Wilson&mdash;<i>the</i> Professor Sales Wilson&mdash;of course,
quite a famous name in literature&mdash;scholarship&mdash;that sort of
thing&mdash;had run away with a shopman! That was what my husband heard,
you know. <i>I</i> merely repeated it."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it, as things go, rather a malicious way of putting it&mdash;on
their part?"</p>

<p>Mrs.&nbsp;Arkwright gave sagacious nods, indicative of comfortable
"<i>we</i>-know-the-world-we-live-in-and-won't-pretend" relationships
between herself and the speaker. They advertised perfect mutual
understanding on a pinnacle of married experience. Fancy there being
any need for anything else between <i>us</i>! they said. Their editor
then supplied explanatory text: "Of course there may have been a
<i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of personal feeling in the case&mdash;bias, pique, whatever one
likes to call it. <i>You</i> know, dear Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick?" But Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick
waited for further illumination. "Well, you know ... I suppose it's
rather a breach of confidence, only I know I shall be safe with
<i>you</i>...."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me any secrets, Mrs.&nbsp;Arkwright. I'm not safe." But Mrs.
Arkwright was not a person to be put off in this way. Not she! She
meant elucidation, and nothing short of bayonets would stop her.</p>

<p>"Well, really, perhaps I'm making it of too much importance to

<!-- Page 468 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
talk
of breaches of confidence. After all, it only amounts to a gentleman
having been disappointed. Of course, his relations would ... don't
you see?..."</p>

<p>"Was it some man that was after Tishy?" asked Rosalind, wondering
how many more rejected suitors were wearing the willow about the
haberdasher's bride. She had heard of one, only last night. She was
not putting two and two together.</p>

<p>"I dare say everybody knows it, and it's only my nonsensical
caution. But one does get <i>so</i> timorous of saying anything. <i>You</i>
know, dear Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick! However, it's better to say it out now&mdash;of
course, quite between ourselves, you know. It was Mrs.&nbsp;Samuel
Herrick's son, Sir Charles Penderfield. He's the present baronet,
you know. Father was in the army&mdash;rather distinguished man, I fancy.
Her second husband was a clergyman...." Here followed social
analysis, some of which Rosalind could have corrected. The speaker
floundered a little among county families, and then resumed the main
theme. "Mrs.&nbsp;Herrick is a sort of connexion of my husband's (I don't
exactly know what; but then, I never <i>do</i> know&mdash;family is such a
bore), and it was <i>she</i> told <i>him</i> all about this. I always forget
these things when they're told <i>me</i>. But I can quite understand that
the young man's mother, in speaking of it ... <i>you</i> understand?..."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, naturally. I think my daughter's coming out. I saw
her machine-door move." Rosalind began collecting herself for
departure.</p>

<p>"But, of course, you won't repeat any of this&mdash;but, of course, I
know I can rely upon you&mdash;but, of course, it doesn't really
matter...." A genial superior tone of toleration for mankind's
foibles as seen by the two speakers from an elevation comes in at
this point juicily. It meets an appreciative response in the
prolonged first syllable of Rosalind's "<i>Cer</i>tainly. I never should
dream," etc., whose length makes up for an imperfect finish&mdash;a
dispersal of context from which a farewell good-morning emerges
clear, hand-in-hand with a false statement that the speaker has
enjoyed sitting there talking.</p>

<p>Rosalind had not enjoyed it at all. She was utilising the merpussy's
return to land as a means of escape, because, had there been no Mrs.
Arkwright, and no folk-chatter, Sally would have come

<!-- Page 469 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
scranching up
the shingle, and flung herself down beside her mother. As it was,
Rosalind's "Oh, <i>I am</i> so glad to get away from that woman!" told a
tale. And Sally's truthful soul interpreted the upshot of that tale
as prohibitive of merely going away and sitting down elsewhere. She
and her mother were in honour bound to have promised to meet
somebody somewhere&mdash;say, for instance, Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker and her son and
donkey-chair. Sally said it, for instance, seeing something of the
sort would soothe the position; and the two of them met the three,
or rather the three and a half, for we had forgotten the boy to whom
the control of the donkey was entrusted, and whose interpretation of
his mission was to beat the donkey incessantly like a carpet, and to
drag it the other way. The last held good of all directions soever.
Which the donkey, who was small, but by nature immovable, requited
by taking absolutely no notice whatever of his exertions.</p>

<p>"What's become of my step-parent? I thought he was going to take you
for a walk." So spoke Sally to Dr.&nbsp;Conrad as she and her mother met
the three others, and the half. The doctor replied:</p>

<p>"He's gone for a walk along the cliff by himself. I would have
gone...." The doctor pauses a moment till the donkey-chair is a few
paces ahead, accompanied by Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick. "I would have gone, only,
you see, it's just mother's last day or two...." Sally apprehends
perfectly. But he shouldn't have dropped his voice. He was quite
distant enough to be inaudible by the Octopus as far as overhearing
words went. But any one can hear when a voice is dropped suddenly,
and words are no longer audible. Dr.&nbsp;Conrad is a very poor
Machiavelli, when all is said and done.</p>

<p>"I can hear <i>every word</i> my boy is saying to your girl, Mrs.
Fenwick." This is delivered with exemplary sweetness by the Octopus,
who then guesses with diabolical acumen at almost the exact wording
of her son's speech. Apparently, no amount of woollen wraps, no
double thickness of green veil to keep the glare out, no smoked
glasses with flanges to make it harmless if it gets in, can obscure
the Goody's penetrative powers when invoked for the discomfiture of
her kind. "But does not my dear boy know," she continues gushily,
"that I am <i>al</i>ways content to be <i>alone</i> as long

<!-- Page 470 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
as I can be
<i>sure</i> that he is happily employed <i>elsewhere</i>. I am a <i>dull old
woman</i>, I know; but, at least, my wish is not to be a burden. That
was the wish of my great-aunt Eliza&mdash;your great-great-aunt, Conrad;
you never saw her&mdash;in her last illness. I borrow her
expression&mdash;'not to be a burden.'" The Octopus, having seized her
prey in this tentacle, was then at liberty to enlarge upon the
unselfish character of her great-aunt, reaping the advantages of a
vicarious egoism from an hypnotic suggestion that that character was
also her own. The great-aunt had, it appeared, lost the use, broadly
speaking, of her anatomy, and could only communicate by signs; but
when she died she was none the less missed by her own circle, whose
grief for her loss took the form of a tablet. The speaker paused a
moment for her hearers to contemplate the tablet, and perhaps ask
for the inscription, when Sally saw an opening, and took advantage
of it.</p>

<p>"Dr.&nbsp;Conrad's going to be very selfish this afternoon, Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker,
and come with us to Chalke, where that dear little church is that
looks like a barn. I mean to find the sexton and get the key this
time."</p>

<p>"My dear, I shall be <i>per</i>fectly happy knitting. Do not trouble
about me for one moment. I shall think how you are enjoying
yourselves. When I was a girl there was nothing I enjoyed more than
ransacking old churches...."</p>

<p>And so forth. Rosalind felt almost certain that Sally either said or
telegraphed to the doctor, who was wavering, "You'll come, you know.
Now, mind; two-thirty punc.," and resolved, if he did <i>not</i> come, to
go to Iggulden's and extract him from the tentacles of his mamma,
and remain entangled herself, if necessary.</p>

<p>In fact, this was how the arrangement for the afternoon worked out.
Dr.&nbsp;Conrad did <i>not</i> turn up, as expected, and Rosalind carried out
her intention. She rescued the doctor, and sent him round to join
her husband and Sally, promising to follow shortly and catch them
up. The three started to walk, but Fenwick, after a little slow
walking to allow Rosalind to overtake them, had misgivings that she
had got caught, and went back to rescue her, telling Sally and the
doctor it was no use to wait&mdash;they would follow on, and take their
chance. And the programme so indicated was acted on.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI"></a>CHAPTER XLI</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF LOVE, CONSIDERED AS A THUNDERSTORM, AND OF AGUR, THE SON OF JAKEH
(PROV. XXX.). OF A COUNTRY WALK AND A JUDICIOUSLY RESTORED CHURCH.
OF TWO CLASPED HANDS, AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES. NOTHING SO VERY
REMARKABLE AFTER&nbsp;ALL!</p>

<p>Love, like a thunderstorm, is very much more intelligible in its
beginnings&mdash;to its chronicler, at least&mdash;than it becomes when it is,
so to speak, overhead. We all know the clear-cut magnificence of the
great thundercloud against the sky, its tremendous deliberation, its
hills and valleys of curdling mist, fraught with God knows what
potential of destruction in volts and ohms; the ceaseless muttering
of its wrath as it speaks to its own heart, and its sullen secrets
reverberate from cavern to cavern in the very core of its innermost
blackness. We know the last prismatic benedictions of the sun it
means to hide from us&mdash;the strange gleams of despairing light on the
other clouds&mdash;clouds that are not in it, mere outsiders or
spectators. We can remember them after we have got home in time to
avoid a wetting, and can get our moist water-colours out and do a
recollection of them before they go out of our heads&mdash;or think we
can.</p>

<p>But we know, too, that there comes a time of a sudden wind and
agitated panic of the trees, and then big, warm preliminary drops,
and then the first clap of thunder, clear in its own mind and full
of purpose. Then the first downpour of rain, that isn't quite so
clear, and wavers for a breathing-space, till the tart reminder of
the first swift, decisive lightning-flash recalls it to its duty,
and it becomes a steady, intolerable torrent that empties roads and
streets of passers-by, and makes the gutters rivulets. And then the
storm itself&mdash;flash upon flash&mdash;peal upon peal&mdash;up to the blinding
and deafening climax, glare and thunderbolt in a breath. And then
it's overhead, and we are sure something has been struck that time.</p>

<p>It was all plain sailing, two days since, in the love-storm we want

<!-- Page 472 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
the foregoing sketch of a thunderstorm to illustrate, that was
brewing in the firmament of Conrad Vereker's soul. At the point
corresponding to the first decisive clap of thunder&mdash;wherever it
was&mdash;Chaos set in in that firmament. And Chaos was developing
rapidly at the time when the doctor, rescued by Sally's intrepidity
from the maternal clutch, started on what he believed would be his
last walk with his idol at St.&nbsp;Sennans. Now he knew that, when he
got back to London, though there might be, academically speaking,
opportunities of seeing Sally, it wasn't going to be the same thing.
That was the phrase his mind used, and we know quite well what it
meant.</p>

<p>Of course, when some peevish author or invalid sends out a servant
to make you take your organ farther off, a good way down the street,
you can begin again exactly where you left off, lower down. But a
barrel-organ has no soul, and one has one oneself, usually. Dr.
Vereker's soul, on this occasion, was the sport of the love-storm of
our analogy, and was tossed and driven by whirlwinds, beaten down by
torrents, dazzled by lightning and deafened by thunder, out of reach
of all sane record by the most eloquent of chroniclers. It was not
in a state to accept calmly the idea of transference to Shepherd's
Bush. A tranquil mind would have said, "By all means, go home and
start afresh." But no; the music in this case refused to welcome the
change. Still, he would forget it&mdash;make light of it and ignore
it&mdash;to enjoy this last little expedition with Sally to the village
church across the downs, that had been so sweetly decorated for the
harvest festival. A bird in the hand was worth two in the bush.
<i>Carpe diem!</i></p>

<p>So Dr.&nbsp;Conrad seemed to have grown younger than ever when he and
Sally got away from all the world, after Fenwick had fallen back to
rescue the captive, octopus-caught. Whereat Sally's heart rejoiced;
for this young man's state of subordination to his skilful and
overwhelming parent was a constant thorn in her side. To say she
felt for him is to say nothing. To say that she would have jumped
out of her skin with joy at hearing that he was engaged to that
young lady, unknown; and that that young lady had successfully made
terms of capitulation, involving the disbanding of the Goody, and
her ultimate dispersal to Bedford Park with a companion&mdash;to vouch
for this actually happening might

<!-- Page 473 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
be rash. But Sally told
herself&mdash;and her mother, for that matter&mdash;that she should so jump
out of her skin; and you may believe her, perhaps. We happen not to;
but it may have been true, for all that.</p>

<p>Agur, the son of Jakeh (Prov. xxx.), evidently thought the souls of
women not worth analysis, and the way of a maid with a man not a
matter for Ithiel and Ucal to spend time and thought over, as they
seem to have said nothing to King Solomon on the subject. But then
Agur candidly admitted that he was more brutish than any man, and
had not the understanding of a man. So he contented himself with
wondering at the way of a man with a maid, and made no remarks about
the opposite case. Even with the understanding of a man, would he
have been any nearer seeing into the mystery of a girl's heart? As
for ourselves, we give it up. We have to be content with watching
what Miss Sally will do next, not trying to understand her.</p>

<p>She certainly <i>believed</i> she believed&mdash;we may go that far&mdash;when she
started to walk to Chalke Church with a young man she felt a strong
interest in, and wanted to see happily settled in life&mdash;(all her
words, please, not ours)&mdash;that she intended, this walk, to get out
of Prosy who the young lady was that he had hinted at, and, what was
more, she knew exactly how she was going to lead up to it. Only she
wouldn't rush the matter; it would do just as well, or better, after
they had seen the little church, and were walking back in the
twilight. They could be jolly and chatty then. Oh yes, certainly a
good deal better. As for any feeling of shyness about it, of relief
at postponing it&mdash;what <i>nonsense</i>! Hadn't they as good as talked it
all over already? But, for our own part, we believe that this
readiness to let the subject wait was a concession Sally made
towards admitting a personal interest in the result of her
inquiry&mdash;so minute a one that maybe you may wonder why we call it a
concession at all. Dr.&nbsp;Conrad was perhaps paltering a little with
the truth, too, when he said to himself that he was quite prepared
to fulfil his half-promise to Fenwick and reveal his mind to Sally;
but not till quite the end of this walk, in case he should spoil it,
and upset Sally. Or, perhaps, to-morrow morning, on the way to the
train. Our own belief is, he was frightened, and it was an excuse.</p>

<p>"We shall go by the beech-forest," was Sally's last speech to
Fenwick,

<!-- Page 474 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
as he turned back on his mission of rescue. And twenty
minutes later she and Dr.&nbsp;Conrad were crossing the smooth
sheep-pasture that ended at the boundary of the said forest&mdash;a tract
of woodland that was always treated with derision on account of its
acreage. It was small, for a forest, certainly; but, then, it hadn't
laid claim to the name itself. Sally spoke forgivingly of it as they
approached it.</p>

<p>"It's a handy little forest," said she; "only you can't lie down in
it without sticking out. If you don't expect to, it doesn't matter."
This was said without a trace of a smile, Sally-fashion. It took its
reasonableness for granted, and allowed the speaker to continue
without a pause into conversation sane and unexaggerated.</p>

<p>"What were you and Jeremiah talking about the day before yesterday,
when you went that long walk?"</p>

<p>"We talked about a good many things. I've forgotten half."</p>

<p>"Which was the one you don't want me to know about? Because you
haven't forgotten that, you know." Vereker thinks of Sally's
putative parents, the Arcadian shepherdess and the thunderbolt.
Obviously a reality! Besides&mdash;so ran the doctor's thought&mdash;with her
looking like <i>that</i>, what can I do? He felt perfectly helpless, but
wouldn't confess it. He would make an effort. One thing he was
certain of: that evasion, with those eyes looking at him, would mean
instant shipwreck.</p>

<p>"We had a long talk, dear Miss Sally, about how much Jeremiah"&mdash;a
slight accent on the name has the force of inverted commas in
text&mdash;"can really recollect of his own history." But Sally's reply
takes a form of protest, without seeming warranty.</p>

<p>"I say, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad, I wish you wouldn't.... However, never mind that
now. I want to know about Jeremiah. Has he remembered a lot more,
and not told?"</p>

<p>"He goes on recovering imperfect versions of things. He told me a
good many such yesterday&mdash;so imperfect that I am convinced as his
mind clears he will find that some of them, though founded on
reality, are little better than dreams. He can't rely on them
himself.... But what is it you wish I wouldn't?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing!&mdash;I'll tell you after. Never mind that now. What are
the things&mdash;I mean, the things he recovers the imperfect versions
of? You needn't tell me the versions, you know,

<!-- Page 475 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
but you might tell
me what they were versions of, without any breach of confidence."
Dr.&nbsp;Conrad has not time for more than a word or two towards the
obvious protest against this way of stating the case, before Sally
becomes frankly aware of her own unfairness. "No, I won't worm out
and inquisit," she says&mdash;and we are bound to give her exact
language. "It isn't fair on a general practitioner to take him for a
walk and get at his professional secrets." The merry eyebrows and
the pearly teeth, slightly in abeyance for a serious moment or two,
are all in evidence again as the black eyes flash round on the
doctor, and, as it were, convey his reprieve to him. He acknowledges
it in this sense.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you don't insist upon my telling, Miss Sally. If you had
insisted, I should have had to tell." He paused a second, drawing an
inference from an expression of Sally's face, then added: "Well,
it's true...."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of that." This refers to her intention to say
something, which never fructified; but somehow got communicated,
magnetically perhaps, to Dr.&nbsp;Conrad. "Never mind what, now. Because
if your soles are as slippy as mine are, we shall never get up.
Catch hold!"</p>

<p>This last refers to the necessity two travellers are under, who,
having to ascend a steep escarpment of slippery grass, can only do
so by mutual assistance. Sally and the doctor got to the top, and
settled down to normal progress on a practicable gradient, and all
the exhilaration of the wide, wind-swept downland. But what had been
to the unconscious merpussy nothing but a mutual accommodation
imposed by a common lot&mdash;common subjection to the forces of
gravitation and the extinction of friction by the reaction of short
grass on leather&mdash;had been to her companion a phase of stimulus to
the storm that was devastating the region of his soul; a new and
prolonged peal of thunder swift on the heels of a blinding
lightning-flash, and a deluge to follow such as a real storm makes
us run to shelter from. On Dr.&nbsp;Conrad's side of the analogy, there
was no shelter, and he didn't ask for it. Had he asked for anything,
it would have been for the power to tell Sally what she had become
to him, and a new language he did not now know in which to tell it.
And such a vocabulary!</p>

<p>But Dr.&nbsp;Conrad didn't know how simple the language was that he

<!-- Page 476 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
felt
the want of&mdash;least of all, that there was only one word in its
vocabulary. And when the two of them got to the top of their
slippery precipice, breathless, he was no nearer the disclosure he
had made up his mind to, and as good as promised Fenwick to make,
than when they were treading the beechmast and listening to the
wood-doves in the handy little forest they had left below. But oh,
the little things in this life that are the big ones all the while,
and no one ever suspects them!</p>

<p>A very little thing indeed was to play a big part, unacknowledged
till after, in the story of this walk. For it chanced that as they
reached the hill-top the diminution of the incline was so gradual
that at no exact point could the lease of Sally's hand to that of
the doctor be determined by either landlord or tenant. We do not
mean that he refused to let go, nor that Sally consciously said to
herself that it would be rude to snatch back the gloveless
six-and-a-half that she had entrusted to him, the very minute she
didn't want his assistance. It was a <i>nuance</i> of action or demeanour
far, far finer than that on the part of either. But it was real all
the same. And the facts of the case were as clear to Sally's
subconsciousness, unadmitted and unconfessed, as though Dr.&nbsp;Conrad
had found his voice then and there, and said out boldly: "There is
<i>no</i> young lady I am wavering about except it be you; she's a
fiction, and a silly one. There is no one in the world I care for as
I do for you. There is nothing in the world that I can name or dream
of so precious to me as this hand that I now give up with
reluctance, under the delusion that I have not held it long enough
to make you guess the whole of the story." All that was said, but
what an insignificant little thing it was that said it!</p>

<p>As for Miss Sally, it was only her subself that recognised that any
one had said anything at all. Her superself dismissed it as a fancy;
and, therefore, being put on its mettle to justify that action, it
pointed out to her that, after that, it would be the merest
cowardice to shirk finding out about Dr.&nbsp;Conrad's young lady. She
would manage it somehow by the end of this walk. But still an
element of postponement came in, and had its say. Yet it excited no
suspicions in her mind, or she ignored them. She was quite within
her rights, technically, in doing so.</p>

<p>It was necessary, though, to tide over the momentary
reciprocity&mdash;the

<!-- Page 477 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
slight exchange of consciousnesses that, if
indulged, must have ended in a climax&mdash;with a show of stiffness; a
little pretence that we were a lady and gentleman taking a walk,
otherwise undescribed. When the doctor relinquished Sally's hand, he
felt bound to ignore the fact that hers went on ringing like a bell
in the palm of his, and sending musical messages up his arm; and to
talk about dewponds. They occur on the tops of downs, and are very
scientific. High service and no rate are the terms of their
water-supply. Dr.&nbsp;Conrad knew all about them, and was aware that one
they passed was also a relic of prehistoric man, who had dug it, and
didn't live long enough, poor fellow! to know it was a dewpond, or
prehistoric. Sally was interested. A little bird with very long legs
didn't seem to care, and walked away without undue hurry, but
amazingly quickly, for all that.</p>

<p>"What a little darling!" Sally said. "Did you hear that delicious
little noise he made? Isn't he a water-ouzel?" Sally took the first
name that she thought sounded probable. She really was making talk,
to contribute her share to the fiction about the lady and gentleman.
So was her companion. He reflected for a moment whether he could say
anything about Grall&aelig; and Scolopacid&aelig;, or such like, but decided
against heaping up instructive matter on the top of the recent
dewponds. He gave it up, and harked back quite suddenly to congenial
personalities.</p>

<p>"What was it you wished I wouldn't, Miss Sally?"</p>

<p>Our Sally had it on her lips to say, "Why, do <i>that</i>&mdash;call me <i>Miss</i>
Sally, of course! I can't <i>tell</i> you how I hate it." But, this time,
she was seized with a sudden fit of shyness. She could have said it
quite easily before that trivial hand-occurrence, and the momentary
stiffness that followed it. Now she backed out in the meanest way,
and even sought to fortify the lady and gentleman pretext. She
looked back over the panorama they were leaving behind, and
discerned that that was Jeremiah and her maternal parent coming
through the clover-field. But it wasn't, palpably. Nevertheless,
Sally held tight to her groundless opinion long enough for the
previous question to be droppable, without effrontery. Then her
incorrigible candour bubbled up, and she refused to take advantage
of her own subterfuge.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad; I'll tell you presently. I've a bone to
pick with you. Wait till we've seen the little
churchy-wurchy&mdash;there

<!-- Page 478 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
it is, over there, with a big
weathercock&mdash;and then we can quarrel and go home separate."</p>

<p>Even Agur, the son of Jakeh, would have seen, at this point, the way
that this particular maid, in addressing this particular man, was
exaggerating a certain spirit of bravado; and if he had been
accompanying them unseen from St.&nbsp;Sennans, would certainly have
deserved his own self-censure if he had failed to trace this spirit
to its source&mdash;the hand-incident. We believe it was only affectation
in Agur, and that he knew all about the subject, men, maids, and
every other sort; only he didn't think any of the female sorts worth
his Oriental consideration. It was a far cry to the dawn of Browning
in those days.</p>

<p>Down the hill to the flatlands was a steep pathway, where talk
paused naturally. When you travel in single file on a narrow footway
with a grass slide to right or left of you, which it does not do to
tread on with shoe-soles well polished on two miles of previous
grass, you don't talk&mdash;especially if you have come to some point in
talk where silence is not unwelcome. Sally and the doctor said
scarcely a dozen words on the way down to the little village that
owned the name and the church of Chalke. When they arrived in its
seclusion they found, for purposes of information and reference, no
human creatures visible except some absolutely brown, white-haired
ones whose existence dated back only a very few years&mdash;not enough to
learn English in. So, when addressed, they remained a speechless
group, too unaccustomed to man to be able to say where keys of
churches were to be had, or anything else. But the eldest, a very
little girl in a flexible blue bonnet, murmured what Sally, with
insight, interpreted into a reference.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, that's right. You go and tell moarther t' whoam that a
lady and gentleman want to see inside the church, and ask for the
key." Whereupon the little maid departs down a passage into a smell
of wallflowers, and is heard afar rendering her message as a long
narrative&mdash;so long that Dr.&nbsp;Conrad says the child cannot have
understood right, and they had better prosecute inquiry further.
Sally thinks otherwise, and says men are impatient fidgets.</p>

<p>The resolute dumbness of one of the small natives must have been a
<i>parti-pris</i>, for it suddenly disappeared during his sister's
absence,

<!-- Page 479 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
and he gave a narrative of a family dissension, not
necessarily recent. He appears proud of his own share in it, which
Sally nevertheless felt she could not appear to sanction by silence.</p>

<p>"You bad little boy," she said. "You smacked your sister Elizabeth
in t' oy, and your foarther smacked you. I hope he hurt." The bad
little boy assented with a nod, and supplied some further details.
Then he asked for a penny before his sister Elizabeth came back. He
wanted it to buy almond-rock, but he wouldn't give any of it to
Jacob, nor to his sister Elizabeth, nor to Reuben, nor to many
others, whom he seemed to exclude from almond-rock with rapture.
Asked to whom he would give some, then, he replied: "Not you&mdash;eat it
moyself!" and laughed heartlessly. Sally, we regret to say, gave
this selfish little boy a penny for not being hypocritical. And then
his sister Elizabeth reappeared with the key, which was out of scale
with her, like St.&nbsp;Peter's.</p>

<p>The inward splendours of this church had been inferred by Sally from
a tiptoe view through the window, which commanded its only archaic
object of interest&mdash;the monument of a woolstapler who, three hundred
and odd years ago, had the effrontery to have two wives and sixteen
children. He ought to have had one or two more wives, thought Dr.
Conrad. However, the family was an impressive one now, decorated as
it was with roses cut out of turnips, and groups of apples and
carrots and cereals. And no family could have kneeled down more
symmetrically, even in 1580.</p>

<p>But there was plenty to see in that church, too. Indeed, it was for
all the world like the advertisement sheets of <i>Architectonic
Ecclesiology</i> (ask for this paper at your club), and every window
was brim full of new stained glass, and every inch of floor-space
was new encaustic tiles. And, what was more, there was a new mosaic
over the chancel-arch&mdash;a modest and wobbly little arch in itself,
that seemed afflicted with its position, and to want to get away
into a quiet corner and meditate. Sally said so, and added so should
she, if she were it.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the woolstapler was married here to one or other of the
little square women," said she.</p>

<p>"I wonder why the angels up there look so sulky," said Dr.&nbsp;Conrad.
And then Sally, who seemed absent-minded, found something

<!-- Page 480 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
else to
wonder about&mdash;a certain musical whistling noise that filled the
little church. But it was only a big bunch of moonwort on a
stained-glass-window sill, and the wind was blowing through a
vacancy that should have been a date, and making &AElig;olian music. The
little maid with the key found her voice over this suddenly. Her
bruvver had done that, she said with pride. He had oymed a stoo-an
when it was putten up, and brokken t' glass. So that stained glass
was very new indeed, evidently.</p>

<p>"I wonder why they call that stuff 'honesty,' Miss Sally?" said the
doctor. Sally, feeling that the interest of either in the church was
really perfunctory, said vaguely&mdash;did they? And then, recoiling from
further wonderment, and, indeed, feeling some terror of becoming
idiotic if this sort of thing went on much longer, she exclaimed,
with reality in her voice: "Because it's not pretending to take an
interest when it doesn't, like us. But I wish you wouldn't, Dr.
Conrad; I do hate it so."</p>

<p>"Hate what? Taking an interest or calling it honesty? <i>I</i> didn't
call it honesty. <i>They</i> did, whoever they are!"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;I don't mean that. Never mind. I'll tell you when we're
out. Come along&mdash;that is, if you've seen enough of the tidy mosaic
and the tidy stained glass, and the tidy nosegays on the tidy
table." The doctor came along&mdash;seemed well satisfied to do so. But
this was the third time Sally had wished that Dr.&nbsp;Conrad wouldn't,
and this time she felt she must explain. She wasn't at all sure that
the name of that herb hadn't somehow got into the atmosphere&mdash;caught
on, as it were, and twitted her. After all, why shouldn't she speak
a plain thought to an old friend, as poor Prosy was now? Who could
gainsay it? Moreover&mdash;now, surely this was an inspiration&mdash;why
shouldn't she kill two birds with one stone, and work in her inquiry
about the other young lady with this plain thought that was on her
tongue to speak?</p>

<p>The sun was a sheer blaze of golden light as they stepped out of the
little church into its farewell efforts on behalf of the
hill-shadowed land of premature sunsets, and the merpussy looked her
best in its effulgence. Sally's good looks had never been such as to
convince her she was a beauty; and we suppose she wasn't, critically
speaking. But youth and health, and an arrow-straight

<!-- Page 481 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
bearing, and
a flawless complexion, in a flood of evening light, make a bold bid
for beauty even in the eyes of others than young men already
half-imbecile with love. Sally's was, at any rate, enough to
dumbfounder the little janitress with the key, who stood at gaze
with violet eyes in her sunbrowned face in the shadow, looking as
though for certain they would never close again; while, as for Dr.
Conrad, he was too far gone to want a finishing touch, and if he had
been, the faintest animation of an extra flush due to embarrassment
at what she was meaning to say would have done the business for him.
What could he do but wonder and idolize, even while he almost
flinched before his idol; and wait to know what it was she wished he
wouldn't? What was there in earth or heaven he would not, if Sally
wished it?</p>

<p>"Dr.&nbsp;Conrad, I'm sure you must know what I mean. I do so hate being
called 'Miss Sally.' Do make it 'Sally,' and have done with it."</p>

<p>The breezy freshness of her spontaneous ease was infectious, and the
shy man's answering laugh showed how it had caught his soul. "Is
that all?" says he. "That's soon done&mdash;Sally! You know, I <i>do</i> call
you Sally when I speak to your mother and...."</p>

<p>"Now, <i>do</i> say father. You've no idea how I like it when people call
Jeremiah my father, instead of step."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;father, then. I mean, <i>they</i> said call you Sally; so of
course I do. But speaking to you&mdash;don't you see?..." The doctor
hesitates&mdash;doesn't actually blush, perhaps. A slight pause in the
conversation eases off the context. The little maiden has to lock up
the church-door with the big key, and to receive sixpence and a kiss
from Sally. The violet eyes follow the lady and gentleman, fixed in
wonderment, as they move off towards the hill, and the last glint of
the sun vanishes. Then Sally goes on where they left off:</p>

<p>"No, I don't see. Speaking to me, what? Be an explicit little
general practitioner, or we shall quarrel, after all, and go home
different ways."</p>

<p>"Well, look here! You know Bailey, the young man that drives me
round in London?"</p>

<p>"Yes. How does he come in?"</p>

<p>"Why, just this way; I've known the youth for years, and the other

<!-- Page 482 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
day if it doesn't turn out that he's been married ever so long! And
when I taxed him with needless secrecy and mistrust of an old
friend, what does the young humbug say? 'The fact is, sir, I hadn't
the cheek to tell you.' Well, <i>I</i> was like that. I hadn't the
cheek."</p>

<p>"At any rate, you have the grace to call him a young humbug. I'm
glad you're repentant, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad."</p>

<p>"Come&mdash;I say, now&mdash;Sally! That's not fair."</p>

<p>"What's not fair?"</p>

<p>"Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. You called me 'Dr.
Conrad.'"</p>

<p>"We-ell, I don't see anything in <i>that</i>. Of course, it's quite a
different thing&mdash;you and me."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. I shall say Miss Sally. Miss Sally!"</p>

<p>Here was Sally's opportunity, clear enough. She had never had a
chance till now of bringing back the mysterious young lady of the
jetty-interview into court, and examining her. She felt quite sure
of herself and her powers of conducting the case&mdash;and she was
mistaken. She knew nothing of the traps and pitfalls that were
gaping for her. Her opening statement went easily though; it was all
prepared.</p>

<p>"Don't you see, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad dear, the cases are quite different? When
you're married, your wife will call <i>me</i> Sally, of course. But ...
well, if I had a husband, you know, <i>he</i> would call <i>you</i> Dr.
Vereker. Sure to!" Sally felt satisfied with the sound of her voice.
But the doctor said never a word, and his face was grave. She would
have to go on, unassisted, and she had invented nothing to say, so
far. So a wavering crept in&mdash;nothing in itself at first, apart from
her consciousness of it. "Besides, though, of course <i>she</i> would
call <i>me</i> Sally, she mightn't quite&mdash;not altogether, you know&mdash;I
mean, she might think it...." But ambushes revealed themselves in
every hedge, ready to break out if she ended this sentence. Dr.
Conrad made completion unnecessary.</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean by <i>she</i>, Sally?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course! Who could I mean but the girl you told me about
that you think wouldn't agree with your mother?"</p>

<p>"I thought so. See what a mess I made of it! No, Sally, there's no
such person. Now I shall have to speak the truth, and then

<!-- Page 483 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
I shall
have to go away from you, and it will all be spoiled...." But Sally
interposes on the tense speech, and sound of growing determination
in the doctor's voice:</p>

<p>"Oh no, don't&mdash;no, don't! Don't say anything that will change it
from <i>now</i>. See how happy we are! How could it be better? I'll call
you Conrad, or anything you like. Only, <i>don't</i> make it different."</p>

<p>"Very well, I won't. I promise!" The doctor calms down. "But, Sally
dearest&mdash;I may say Sally dearest, mayn't I?..."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps. Only you must make that do for the present."</p>

<p>But there is a haunting sense of the Octopus in the conscientious
soul of her son, and even though he is allowed to say "Sally
dearest," the burden is on him of knowing that he has been swept
away in the turmoil of this whirlwind of self, and he is feeling
round to say <i>peccavi</i>, and make amends by confession. He makes
"Sally dearest" do for the moment, but captures as a set-off the
hand that slips readily enough into the arm he offers for it, with a
caressing other hand, before he speaks again. He renews his
promise&mdash;but with such a compensation in the hand that remains at
rest in his! and then continues:</p>

<p>"Dearest Sally, I dare say you see how it was&mdash;about mother. It was
very stupid of me, and I did it very badly. I got puzzled, and lost
my head."</p>

<p>"I thought it was a real young lady, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I saw you did. And I do think&mdash;just now&mdash;I should have let you
continue believing in the real young lady ... only when you said
that...."</p>

<p>"Said what?"</p>

<p>"Said that about your husband, and calling me Conrad. I couldn't
stand it. It was just like a knife ... no, I'm in earnest, it <i>was</i>.
How could I have borne it&mdash;gone on at all&mdash;with you married to any
one else?" He asks this in a tone of serious conviction, of one who
is diagnosing a strange case, conscientiously. Sally declines
consultation&mdash;won't be too serious over it.</p>

<p>"You would have had to. Men get on capitally when they have to. But
very likely I won't marry you. Don't be too sure! I haven't
committed myself, you know." Nevertheless, the hand remains passive
in the doctor's, as he continues his diagnosis:</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 484 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"I shouldn't deserve you. But, then, who could?"</p>

<p>Sally tacitly refuses to help in answering this question.</p>

<p>"I vote for neither of us marrying anybody else, but going on like
now," says she thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Sally, you see, was recovering herself after a momentary alarm,
produced by the gust of resolution on Dr.&nbsp;Conrad's part. She had
shut her window on the storm in his soul, and felt safe in resuming
her identity. All through this walk, ever since the hand-incident,
she had been hard at work ignoring suggestions of her inner mind
that her companion was a loaded gun, and not quite safe to play
with. Now she felt she had established a sort of <i>modus vivendi</i>
which would not involve her in the horrors of a formal engagement,
with the concomitants of dissension and bitterness that she had
noticed in friends' families on such occasions. Why shouldn't she
and poor Prosy walk about together as much as they liked&mdash;yes, even
call in at a church and get married if they liked&mdash;and have no one
else fussing over them? The sort of semi-trothplight she had just
hushed into silence would do for a good long time to come, because
she understood Prosy down to the ground, and, of course, she knew
that his mistrusting her was out of the question.</p>

<p>As for the doctor, his was the sort of temperament one often meets
with in very fair men of his type&mdash;intensely shy, but with a backing
of resolution on occasion shown, bred of a capacity for high-strung
passion. He had formed his intention fully and clearly of telling
Sally the whole truth before they arrived at St.&nbsp;Sennans that
evening, and had been hastened to what was virtually an avowal by a
premature accident, as we have seen. Now the murder was out, and he
was walking home slowly beside the marvel, the mystery, that had
taken possession of the inmost recesses of his life&mdash;very much in
her pocket, if the truth must be told&mdash;with an almost intolerable
searching fire of joy finding every moment a new untouched recess in
his innermost heart. He could have fallen at her feet and kissed
them, could have poured out his very soul in passionate
protestations, could and would have done anything that would have
given a moment's respite to the tension of his love for this
all-absorbing other creature that was absolutely here&mdash;a reality,
and no dream&mdash;beside him. But he was going to be good, at her
bidding, and remain

<!-- Page 485 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
a sane and reasonable general practitioner,
however much his heart beat and his head swam. Poor Prosy!</p>

<p>No! On consideration, Agur, the son of Jakeh, didn't know all about
it. He only knew the Oriental temperament. He was quite up to date,
no doubt, but neither he nor Ithiel nor Ucal nor King Solomon could
reckon with spiritual volcanoes. Probably nothing in the world could
have explained to either of them the meaning of one or two bits of
music Schubert wrote on this subject of Love&mdash;we don't flinch from
our phraseology; we know that all will understand it whom we care
should do so. By-the-bye, Dr.&nbsp;Vereker was partly German, and a
musician. Agur can have had no experience of either. The ancestors
of Schubert and Beethoven were splendid savages in his day, sleeping
on the snow-wreaths in the forests of the north; and somewhere among
them there was a germ of a love-passion that was one day to ring
changes on the peals that were known to Agur, the son of Jakeh.</p>

<p>But this is wandering from the point, and all the while Sally and
her lover have been climbing that hill again, and are now walking
over the lonely down above, towards the sun, and their shadows are
long behind them&mdash;at least, their shadow; for they have but one, and
we fancy we have let some of our record slip, for the man's arm is
round the girl's waist. Yes, some further clearer understanding has
come into their lives, and maybe Sally sees by now that the vote she
passed <i>nem. con.</i> may be rescinded in the end.</p>

<p>If you had been near them then, invisible, we know you would not
have gone close and listened. You would have been too honourable.
But you would only have heard this&mdash;take our word for it!</p>

<p>"Do you know what I always call you behind your back? I always call
you Prosy. I don't know why."</p>

<p>"Because I <i>am</i> prosy&mdash;level-headed, slow sort of card&mdash;but prosy
beyond a doubt."</p>

<p>"No, you're not. I don't think you know the least what you're like.
But I shall call you Prosy, all the same, or whatever I choose!"</p>

<p>"You don't take to Conrad, somehow?"</p>

<p>"It sounds so reproachful. It's like William."</p>

<p>"Does William sound reproachful?"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 486 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Of course it does! Willy-yum! A most reproachful name. No, Prosy
dear, I shall call you Prosy, whatever the consequences may be.
People must put their own construction upon it."</p>

<p>"Mother calls me Conny very often."</p>

<p>"When she's not taking exception to you ... oh, no! I know. I was
only joking ... there, then! we won't quarrel and go home opposite
ways about that. Besides, I'm the young lady...."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sally darling, dearest, it does make me feel such a fool.
Please don't!"</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense, Prosy dear! I shall, if I choose. So there!...
No, but seriously&mdash;<i>why</i> did you think I shouldn't get on well with
your mother?" Poor Prosy looks very much embarrassed at this point;
his countenance pleads for respite. But Sally won't let him off. And
he is as wax in her hands, and she knows it, and also that every
word that passes her coral lips seems to the poor stricken man a
pearl of wisdom. And she is girl enough to enjoy her power, is
Sally.</p>

<p>"<i>Why</i> do you think I shan't get on with her?" Note the slight
variation in the question, driving the nail home, leaving no escape.
The doctor's manner in reply is that of one who appeals to Truth
herself to help him, before a court that acknowledges no other
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>"Because ... I must say it because it's true, only it seems so ...
so disloyal, you might say, to mother...."</p>

<p>"Well! Because what?"</p>

<p>"Because then it won't be the same as <i>your</i> mother. It can't be."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Sally&mdash;dearest love&mdash;how can it?"</p>

<p>"Well! Perhaps <i>why not</i> was fibs. And, of course, mother's an
angel, so it's not fair. But, Prosy dear, I'll tell you one thing I
<i>do</i> think&mdash;that affectionate sons make very bad medical attendants
for their ma's; and I should say the same if they had all the
degrees in Christendom."</p>

<p>"You think a nervous element comes in?..."</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>And so the conversation ripples on, a quiet undertone of perfect
confidence, freedom without reserve as to another self, suddenly

<!-- Page 487 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
discovered in the working identity of a fellow-creature. It ripples
on just thus, all the distance of the walk along the topmost down,
in the evening sunlight, and then comes a pause to negotiate the
descent to their handy little forest below. Then a sense that they
are coming back into a sane, dry world, and must be a lady and a
gentleman again. But there must be a little farewell to the
enchanted land they are leaving behind&mdash;a recognition of its story,
under the beech-trees as the last gleam goes, and leaves us our
inheritance of twilight.</p>

<p>"Do you remember, darling, how we climbed up there, coming, and had
hold to the top?" His lips find hers, naturally and without
disguise. It is the close of the movement, and company-manners will
be wanted directly. But just a bar or two, and a space, before the
music dies!...</p>

<p>"I remember," says Sally. "That began it. Oh, what a long time ago
that does seem now! What a rum start it all is&mdash;the whole turn-out!"
For the merpussy is her incorrigible self, and will be to the last.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>When Sally reached home, very late, she was not displeased, though
she was a little surprised, to find that Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit was keeping
dinner back, and that her mother and Fenwick had not reappeared,
having been away since they parted. Not displeased, because it gave
her time to settle down&mdash;the expression she made use of, to think
with; not with any admission, however, that she either felt or
looked unusually <i>exalt&eacute;e</i>&mdash;but surprised, because it was eight
o'clock, and she felt that even Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit's good-nature might
have limits.</p>

<p>But while she was settling down, in a happy, excited dream she half
wondered that she did not wake from, back came the truants; and she
heard from her room above Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit's report that Miss Sally was
gone upstairs to get ready, with the faintest hint of reproach in
the tone. Then her mother's "Don't stop to read letters,
Gerry&mdash;that'll do after," and Fenwick's "All right!" not followed by
immediate obedience. Then, after half a moment's delay, in which she
felt some surprise at herself for not going out to meet them coming
up the stairs, her mother's voice approaching, that asked where the
kitten was.</p>

<p>"Oh, here you are, chick!&mdash;how long have you been in? Why,
Sallykin!

<!-- Page 488 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
what is it, child?... Oh, Gerry&mdash;Gerry&mdash;come up here and
hear this!" For the merpussy, in spite of many stoical resolutions,
had merged a beginning of verbal communication in a burst of happy
tears on her mother's bosom.</p>

<p>And when Fenwick, coming upstairs three steps at a time, filled the
whole house with "Hullo, Sarah! what's the latest intelligence?"
this young lady had only just time to pull herself together into
something like dignified self-possession, in order to reply
ridiculously&mdash;how could she have been our usual Sally,
else?&mdash;"We-ell! I don't see that it's anything so very remarkable,
after all. I've been encouraging my medical adviser's attentions, if
you want to know, Jeremiah."</p>

<p>Was it only a fancy of Sally's, as she ended off a hurried toilet,
for Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit's sake, or did her mother say to Fenwick,
"Well!&mdash;<i>that</i> is something delightful, at any rate"? As though it
were in some sense a set-off against something not delightful
elsewhere.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII"></a>CHAPTER XLII</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF A RECURRENCE FROM <i>AS YOU LIKE IT</i> AND HOW FENWICK DIDN'T. WHY A
SAILOR WOULD NOT LEARN TO SWIM. THE BARON AGAIN. OF A CUTTLE-FISH
AND HIS SQUIRT. OF THE POWER OF <i>A PRIORI</i> REASONING. OF SALLY'S
CONFESSION, AND HOW FENWICK WENT TO A FIRST-CLASS HOTEL</p>

<p>When Fenwick turned back towards home, ostensibly to shorten
Rosalind's visit to the doctor's mother, he had no intention of
doing so early enough to allow of his rejoining his companions,
however slowly they might walk. Neither did he mean to deprive old
Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker of Rosalind until she had had her full allowance of
her. In an hour would do&mdash;or three-quarters. He discounted
twenty-five per cent., owing to a recollection of the green veil and
spectacles. Then he felt unkind, and said to himself, that, after
all, the old woman couldn't help it.</p>

<p>Fenwick felt he was making a great concession in giving up
three-quarters of an hour of Rosalind. As soon as he had had
exercise enough for the day, and was in a mood to smoke and saunter
about idly, he wanted Rosalind badly, and was little disposed to
give her up. But the old Goody was going away to-morrow, and he
would be liberal. He would take a turn along the sea-front&mdash;would
have time to get down to the jetty&mdash;and then would invade the cave
of the Octopus and extract the prisoner from its tentacles.</p>

<p>His intention in forsaking Sally and the doctor was half suspected
by the latter, quite clear to himself, and only unperceived by his
opaque stepdaughter. As he idled down towards the old
fisher-dwellings and the net-huts, he tried to picture the form the
declaration would take, and the way it would be received. That this
would be favourable he never doubted for a moment; but he recalled
the speech of Benedict to Beatrice, "By my troth I take thee for
pity," and fancied Sally's response might be of the same complexion.
His recollection of these words produced a

<!-- Page 490 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
mental recurrence, a
distressing and imperfect one, connected with the earlier time he
could not reach back to, of the words being used to himself by a
girl who ascribed them to Rosalind in <i>As You Like It</i>, and a
discussion after of their whereabouts in Shakespeare.</p>

<p>The indescribable wrench this gave his mind was so painful that he
was quite relieved to recall Vereker's opinion that it was always
the imperfection of the memory and the effort that gave pain, not
the thing remembered. And in this case there could be no doubt that
it was a mere dream, for the girl not only took the form of his
Rosey he was going back to directly, but actually claimed her name,
saying distinctly, "like my namesake, Celia's friend, in
Shakespeare." Could any clearer proof be given that it was mere
brain-froth?</p>

<p>The man with "Bessie" and "Elinor" tattooed on his arm was enjoying
a pipe and mending a net, not to be too idle. The glass might be
rising&mdash;or not. He was independent of Science. A trifle of wind in
the night was his verdict, glass or no! The season was drawing nigh
to a close now for a bathing-resort, as you might say. Come another
se'nnight, you wouldn't see a machine down, as like as not. But you
could never say, to a nicety. He'd known every lodging in the old
town full, times and again, to the end of September month, before
now. But this year was going to fall early, and your young lady
would lose her swimming.</p>

<p>"She's a rare lass, too, for the water," he concluded, without any
consciousness of familiarity in the change of phrase. "Not that I
know much myself, touching swimming and the like. For I can't swim
myself, never a stroke."</p>

<p>"That's strange, too, for a seaman," said Fenwick.</p>

<p>"No, sir! Not so strange as you might think it. You ask up and down
among we, waterside or seafaring, and you'll find a many have never
studied it, for the purpose. Many that would make swimmers, with a
bit of practice, will hold off, for the reason I tell you. Overboard
in mid-ocean, and none to help, and not a spar, would you soonest
drown, end on, or have to fight for it, like it or no?"</p>

<p>"Drown! The sooner the better." Fenwick has no doubt about the
matter.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 491 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Why, sure! So I say, master. And I've put no encouragement on young
Benjamin, over yonder, to give study to the learning of it, for the
same reason. And not a stroke can he swim, any more than his
father."</p>

<p>"Well! I can't swim myself, so there's three of us!" said Fenwick.
"My daughter swims enough for the lot." It gave him such pleasure to
speak thus of Sally boldly, where there need be no exact definition
of their kinship. The net-mender pursued the subject with the kind
of gravity on him that always comes on a seaman when drowning is
under discussion.</p>

<p>"She's a rare one, for sure. Never but three, or may be fower, have
I seen in my time to come anigh to her&mdash;man nor woman. The best
swimmer a long way I've known&mdash;Peter Burtenshaw by name&mdash;I helped
bring to after drowning. He'd swum&mdash;at a guess&mdash;the best part of six
hours afower we heard the cry of him on our boat. Too late a bit we
were, but we found him, just stone-dead like, and brought him round.
It was what Peter said of that six hours put me off of letting 'em
larn yoong Benjamin to swim when he was a yoongster. And when he got
to years of understanding I told him my mind, and he never put
himself to study it."</p>

<p>Fenwick would have liked to go on talking with the fisherman, as his
mental recurrence about Shakespeare had fidgeted him, and he found
speech a relief. But some noisy visitors from the new St.&nbsp;Sennans on
the cliff above had made an irruption into the little old
fishing-quarter, and the attention of the net-mender was distracted
by possibilities of a boat-to-day being foisted on their simplicity;
it was hardly rough enough to forbid the idea. Fenwick, therefore,
sauntered on towards the jetty, but presently turned to go back, as
half his time had elapsed.</p>

<p>As he repassed the net-mender with a short word or two for
valediction, his ear was caught by a loud voice among the party of
visitors, who were partly sitting on the beach, partly throwing
stones in the water. Something familiar about that voice, surely!</p>

<p>"I gannod throw stoanss. I am too vat. I shall sit on the peach and
see effrypotty else throw stoanss. I shall smoke another cigar. Will
you haff another cigar, Mr.&nbsp;Prown? You will not? Ferry well! Nor
you, Mrs.&nbsp;Prown? Not for the worlt? Ferry

<!-- Page 492 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
well! Nor you, Mr.
Bilkington? Ferry well! I shall haff one myself, and you shall throw
stoanss." And then, as though to remove the slightest doubt about
the identity of the speaker, the voice broke into song:</p>

<p class="song">
"Ich hatt' einen Kameraden,<br />
Einen bessern findst du nicht&mdash;"
</p>

<p>but ended on "Mein guter Kamerad," exclaiming stentorianly,
"Opleitch me with a madge," and lighting his cigar in spite of his
companions' indignation at the music stopping.</p>

<p>Fenwick stood hesitating a moment in doubt what to do. His
inclination was to go straight down the beach to his old friend,
whom&mdash;of course, you understand?&mdash;he now remembered quite well, and
explain the strange circumstances that had rendered their meeting in
Switzerland abortive. But then!&mdash;what would the effect be on his
present life, in his relation to Rosalind and (almost as important)
to Sally? Diedrich Kreutzkammer had been, for some time in
California, a most intimate friend. Fenwick had made him the
confidant of his marriage and his early life, all that he had since
forgotten, and he had it now in his power to recover all this from
the past. Strange to say, although he could remember the telling of
these things, he could only remember weak, confused snatches of what
he told. It was unaccountable&mdash;but there!&mdash;he could not try to
unravel that skein now. He must settle, and promptly, whether to
speak to the Baron or to run.</p>

<p>He was not long in coming to a decision, especially as he saw that
hesitation was sure to end in the adoption of the former
course&mdash;probably the wrong one. He just caught the Baron's last
words&mdash;a denunciation of the hotel he was stopping at, loud enough
to reach the new St.&nbsp;Sennans, of which it was the principal
constituent&mdash;and then walked briskly off. He arrived at Iggulden's
within the hour he had first conceded to the Octopus, and got
Rosalind out for a walk, as originally proposed.</p>

<p>There was no apparent reason why the impossibility of overtaking
Sally and the doctor should be interpreted into an excuse for going
in the opposite direction; but each accepted it as such, or as a
justification at least. Rosalind had not so distinct a reason as her
husband for wishing not to break in upon them, as he

<!-- Page 493 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
had not
reported the whole of his last talk with Vereker. But though she did
not know that Dr.&nbsp;Conrad had as good as promised to make a clean
breast of it before returning to London, she thought nothing was
more likely than that he should do so, and resolved to leave the
stage clear for the leading parts. She may even have flattered
herself that she was showing tact&mdash;keeping an unconscious Gerry out
of the way, who might else interfere with the stars in their
courses, in the manner of the tactless. Rosalind suspected this of
Sally, that whatever she might think she thought, and whatever
parade she made of an even mind no sentiments whatever prevailed in,
there was in her inmost heart another Sally, locked in and
unconfessed, that had strong views on the subject. And she wanted
this Sally to be let out for a spell, or for poor Prosy to be
allowed into her cell long enough to speak for himself. Anyhow, this
was their last chance here, and she wasn't going to spoil it.</p>

<p>She had gone near to making up her mind&mdash;after her sufferings from
Gwenny's mamma in the morning&mdash;to attempt, at any rate, a
communication of their joint story to her husband. But it <i>must</i>
depend on circumstances and possibilities. She foresaw a long period
of resolutions undermined by doubts, decisions rescinded at the last
moment, and suddenly-revealed ambushes, and perhaps in the end
self-reproach for a mismanaged revelation that might have been so
much more skilfully done. Never mind&mdash;it was all in the day's work!
She had borne much, and would bear more.</p>

<p>"How do you know they are all nonsense, Gerry darling?" We catch
their conversation in the middle as they walk along the sands the
tide is leaving clear, after accommodating the few morning-bathers
with every opportunity to get out of their depths. "How do you
<i>know</i>? Surely the parts that you <i>do</i> seem to remember clearly
<i>must</i> be all right, however confused the rest is."</p>

<p>Fenwick gives his head the old shake, dashes his hair across his
brow and rubs it, then replies: "The worst of the job is, you see,
that the bits I remember clearest are the greatest gammon. What do
you make of that?"</p>

<p>Rosalind's hand closes on her nettle. "Instance, Gerry!&mdash;give me an
instance, and I shall know what you mean."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 494 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Fenwick is outrageously confident of the safety of his last
imperfect recollection. He can trust to its absurdity if he can
trust to anything.</p>

<p>"Well! For instance, just now&mdash;an hour ago&mdash;I recollected something
about a girl who would have it Rosalind in <i>As You Like It</i> said,
'By my troth I take thee for pity,' to Orlando. And all the while it
was Benedict said it to Beatrice in <i>All's Well that Ends Well</i>."</p>

<p>The hand on the nettle tightens. "Gerry <i>dearest</i>!" she
remonstrates. "There's nothing in <i>that</i>, as Sallykin says. Of
course it <i>was</i> Benedict said it to Beatrice."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but the gammon wasn't in that. It was the girl that said it.
When I tried to think who it was, she turned into <i>you</i>! I mean, she
became exactly like you."</p>

<p>"But I'm a woman of forty." This was a superb piece of
nettle-grasping; and there was not a tremor in the voice that said
it, and the handsome face of the speaker was calm, if a little pale.
Fenwick noticed nothing.</p>

<p>"Like what I should suppose you were as a girl of eighteen or
twenty. It's perfectly clear how the thing worked. It was from
something else I seem to recollect her saying, 'Like my namesake,
Celia's friend in Shakespeare.' The moment she said that, of course
the name Rosalind made me think you into the business. It was quite
natural."</p>

<p>"Quite natural! And when I was that girl that was what I said." She
had braced herself up, in all the resolution of her strong nature,
to the telling of her secret, and his; and she thought this was her
opportunity. She was mistaken. For as she stood, keeping, as it
were, a heartquake in abeyance, till she should see him begin to
understand, he replied without the least perceiving her
meaning&mdash;evidently accounting her speech only a variant on "If I
<i>had</i> been that girl," and so forth&mdash;"Of course you did,
sweetheart," said he, with a laugh in his voice, "<i>when</i> you were
that girl. And I expect that girl said it when she was herself,
whoever she was, and the name Rosalind turned her into you? Look at
this cuttlefish before he squirts."</p>

<p>For a moment Rosalind Fenwick was almost two people, so distinctly
did the two aspects or conditions of herself strike her mind. The
one was that of breath drawn freely, of a respite, a reprieve,

<!-- Page 495 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
a
heartquake escaped; for, indeed, she had begun to feel, as she
neared the crisis, that the trial might pass her powers of
endurance. The other of a new terror&mdash;that the tale, perhaps, <i>could
not be told at all</i>! that, unassisted by a further revival of her
husband's memory, it would remain permanently incredible by him,
with what effect of a half-knowledge of the past God only knew. The
sense of reprieve got the better of the new-born apprehension&mdash;bid
it stand over for a while, at least. Sufficient for the day was the
evil thereof.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Gerry, absolutely unconscious of her emotion, and seeming
much less disconcerted over this abortive recollection than over
previous ones, stood gazing down into the clear rock-pool that
contained the cuttlefish. "Do come and look at him, Rosey love,"
said he. "His manners are detestable, but there can be no doubt
about the quality of his black."</p>

<p>She leaned a bit heavily on the arm she took as they left the
cuttlefish to his ill-conditioned solitude. "Tired, dearest?" said
her husband; and she answered, "Just a little!" But his mind was a
clean sheet on which his story would have to be written in ink as
black as the cuttlefish's Parthian squirt, and in a full round hand
without abbreviations, unless it should do something to help itself.
Let it rest while she rested and thought.</p>

<p>She thought and thought&mdash;happy for all her strain of nerve and mind,
on the quiet stretch of sand and outcrop of chalk, slippery with
weed, that the ebbing tide would leave safe for them for hours to
come. So thinking, and seeing the way in which her husband's reason
was entrenched against the facts of his own life, in a citadel
defended by human experience at bay, she wavered in her resolution
of a few hours since&mdash;or, rather, she saw the impossibility of
forcing the position, thinking contentedly that at least if it was
so impracticable to her it would be equally so to other agencies,
and he might be relied on to remain in the dark. The <i>status quo</i>
would be the happiest, if it could be preserved. So when, after a
two hours' walk through the evening glow and the moonrise, Rosalind
came home to Sally's revelation, as we have seen, the slight
exception her voice took to universal rejoicing was the barest echo
of the tension of her absolutely unsuccessful attempt to get in the
thin end of the wedge of an incredible revelation.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 496 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
</div>

<p>Quite incredible! So hopeless is the case of a mere crude,
unadulterated fact against an irresistible <i>a priori</i> belief in its
incredibility.</p>

<p>Sally was reserved about details, but clear about the outcome of her
expedition with Prosy. They perfectly understood each other, and it
wasn't anybody else's concern; present company's, of course,
excepted. Questioned as to plans for the future&mdash;inasmuch as a
marriage did not seem inconsequent under the circumstances&mdash;Sally
became enigmatical. The word "marriage" had not been so much as
mentioned. She admitted the existence of the institution, but
proposed&mdash;now and for the future&mdash;to regard it as premature. Wasn't
even sure she would tell anybody, except Tishy; and perhaps also
Henriette Prince, because she was sure to ask, and possibly Karen
Braun if she did ask. But she didn't seem at all clear what she was
going to say to them, as she objected to the expression "engaged." A
thing called "it" without an antecedent, got materialised, and did
duty for something more intelligible. Yes!&mdash;she would tell Tishy
about It, and just those one or two others. But if It was going to
make any difference, or there was to be any fuss, she would just
break It off, and have done with It.</p>

<p>Sentiments of this sort provoked telegraphic interchanges of
smile-suggestion between her hearers all through the evening meal
that was so unusually late. This lateness received sanction from the
fact that Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick would very likely have letters by the morning
post that would oblige him to return to town by the afternoon train.
If so, this was his last evening, and clearly nothing mattered. Law
and order might be blowed, or hanged.</p>

<p>It was, under these circumstances, rather a surprise to his hearers
when he said, after smoking half through his first cigar, that he
thought he should walk up to the hotel in the new town, because he
fancied there was a man there he knew. As to his name, he thought it
was Pilkington, but wasn't sure. Taunted with reticence, he said it
was nothing but business. As Rosalind could easily conceive that
Gerry might not want to introduce all the Pilkingtons he chanced
across to his family, she didn't press for explanation. "He'll very
likely call round to see your young man, chick, when he's done with
Pilkington." To which Sally replied,

<!-- Page 497 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
"Oh, <i>he'll</i> come round here.
Told him to!" Which he did, at about ten o'clock. But Fenwick had
never called at Iggulden's, neither had he come back to his own
home. It was after midnight before his foot was on the stairs, and
Sally had retired for the night, telling her mother not to
fidget&mdash;Jeremiah would be all right.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII"></a>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF AN OBSERVANT AND THOUGHTFUL, BUT SNIFFY, WAITER; AND HOW HE
OPENED A NEW BOTTLE OF COGNAC. HOW THE BARON SAW FENWICK HOME,
WITHOUT HIS HAT. AN OLD MEMORY FROM ROSALIND'S PAST AND HIS. AND
THEN FACE TO FACE WITH THE WHOLE. SLEEP UPON IT! BUT WHAT BECAME OF
HIS HORRIBLE&nbsp;BABY?</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock that night a respectable man with weak eyes and a
cold was communing with a commanding Presence that lived in a
bureau&mdash;nothing less!&mdash;in the entrance-hall of the big hotel at the
new St.&nbsp;Sennans. It was that of a matron with jet earrings and
tube-curls and a tortoise-shell comb, and an educated contempt for
her species. It lived in that bureau with a speaking-pipe to speak
to every floor, and a telephone for the universe beyond. He that now
ventured to address it was a waiter, clearly, for he carried a
table-napkin, on nobody's behalf and uselessly, but with a feeling
for emblems which might have made him Rouge Dragon in another
sphere. As it was, he was the head waiter in the accursed restaurant
or dining-<i>salon</i> at the excruciating new hotel, where he would
bring you cold misery from the counter at the other end, or lukewarm
depression <i>&agrave; la carte</i> from the beyond&mdash;but nothing that would do
you any good inside, from anywhere.</p>

<p>"Are those parties going, in eighty-nine, do you make out?" The
Presence speaks, but with languid interest.</p>

<p>"Hapathetic party, and short customer. Takes you up rather free.
Name of Pilkington. Not heard 'em say anything!"</p>

<p>"Who did you say was going?"</p>

<p>"The German party. Party of full 'abit. Call at seven in the
morning. Fried sole and cutlets <i>&agrave; la</i> mangtynong and sweet omelet
at seven-thirty sharp. Too much by way of smoking all day, in my
thinking! But they say plums and greengages, took all through meals,
is a set-off."</p>

<p>"I don't pretend to be an authority. Isn't that him, in the
smoking-room?"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 499 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"Goin' on in German? Prob'ly." Both stop and listen. What they hear
is the Baron, going on very earnestly indeed in German. What keeps
them listening is that another voice comes in occasionally&mdash;a voice
with more than mere earnestness in it; a voice rather of anguish
under control. Then both voices pause, and silence comes suddenly.</p>

<p>"Who's the other party?"</p>

<p>"In a blue soote, livin' in one of the sea-'ouses down on the beach.
Big customer. Prodooces a rousin' impression!"</p>

<p>"Is that his daughter that swims?... That's him&mdash;coming away."</p>

<p>But it isn't. It is the Baron, wrathful, shouting, swearing, neither
in German nor English, but in either or both. Where is that tamned
kellner? Why does he not answer the pell? This is an <i>abscheuliches</i>
hotel, and every one connected with it is an <i>Esel</i>. What he wants
is some cognac and a doctor forthwith. His friend has fainted, and
he has been pressing the tamned puddon, and nobody comes.</p>

<p>The attitude of the lady with the earrings epitomizes the complete
indifference of a hotel-keeper to the private lives of its guests
nowadays. That bell must be seen to, she says. Otherwise she is
callous. The respectable waiter hurries for the cognac, and returns
with a newly-drawn bottle and two glasses to the smoking-room, to
find that the gentleman has recovered and won't have any. He
suggests that our young man could step round for Dr.&nbsp;Maccoll; but
the proposed patient says, "The devil fly away with Dr.&nbsp;Maccoll!"
which doesn't look like docility. The respectable waiter takes note
of his appearance, and reports of it to his principal on dramatic
grounds, not as a matter into which human sympathies enter.</p>

<p>"Very queer he looks. Doo to reaction, or the coatin's of the
stomach. Affectin' the action of the heart.... No, there's nobody
else in the smoking-room. Party with the 'ook instead of a hand's
watching of 'em play penny-pool in the billiard-room." Surely a tale
to bring a tear to the eye of sensibility! But not to one that sees
in mankind only a thing that comes and goes and pays its bill&mdash;or
doesn't. The lady in the bureau appears to listen slightly to the
voices that come afresh from the smoking-room, but their duration is
all she is concerned with. "He's

<!-- Page 500 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
going now," she says. He is; and
he does look queer&mdash;very queer. His companion does not leave him at
the door, but walks out into the air with him without his hat,
speaking to him volubly and earnestly, always in German. His speech
suggests affectionate exhortation, and the way he takes his arm is
affectionate. The voices go out of hearing, and it is so long before
the Baron returns, hatless, that he must have gone all the way to
the sea-houses down on the beach.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Sally retired to her own couch in order to supply an inducement to
her mother to go to bed herself, and sit up no longer for Gerry's
return, which might be any time, of course. Rosalind conceded the
point, and was left alone under a solemn promise not to be a goose
and fidget. But she was very deliberate about it; and though she
didn't fidget, she went all the slower that she might think back on
a day&mdash;an hour&mdash;of twenty years ago, and on the incident that Gerry
had half recalled, quite accurately as far as it went, but strangely
unsupported by surroundings or concomitants.</p>

<p>It came back to her with both. She could remember even the face of
her mother's coachman Forsyth, who had driven her with Miss
Stanynaught, her <i>chaperon</i> in this case, to the dance where she was
to meet Gerry, as it turned out; and how Forsyth was told not to
come for them before three in the morning, as he would only have to
wait; and how Miss Stanynaught, her governess of late, who was over
forty, pleaded for two, and Forsyth <i>did</i> have to wait; and how she
heard the music and the dancing above, for they were late; and how
they waded upstairs against a descending stream of muslin skirts and
marked attentions going lawnwards towards the summer night, and bent
on lemonade and ices; and then their entry into the dancing-room,
and an excited hostess and daughters introducing partners like mad;
and an excited daughter greeting a gentleman who had come upstairs
behind them, with "Well, Mr.&nbsp;Palliser, you <i>are</i> late. You don't
deserve to be allowed to dance at all." And that was Jessie Nairn,
of course, who added, "I've jilted you for Arthur Fenwick."</p>

<p>How well Rosalind could remember turning round and seeing a splendid
young chap who said, "What a jolly shame!" and didn't seem to be
oppressed by that or anything else; also Jessie's further

<!-- Page 501 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
speech,
apologizing for having also appropriated Miss Graythorpe's partner.
So they would have to console each other. What a saucy girl Jessie
was, to be sure! She introduced them with a run, "Mr.&nbsp;Algernon
Palliser, Miss Rosalind Graythorpe, Miss Rosalind Graythorpe, Mr.
Algernon Palliser," and fled. And Rosalind was piqued about Arthur
Fenwick's desertion. It seemed all so strange now&mdash;such a vanished
world! Just fancy!&mdash;she had been speculating if she should accept
Arthur, if he got to the point of offering himself.</p>

<p>But a shaft from Cupid's bow must have been shot from a slack
string, for Rosalind could remember how quickly she forgot Arthur
Fenwick as she took a good look at Gerry Palliser, his great friend,
whom he had so often raved about to her, and who was to be brought
to play lawn-tennis next Monday. And then to the ear of her mind,
listening back to long ago, came a voice so like the one she was to
hear soon, when that footstep should come on the stair.</p>

<p>"I can't waltz like Arthur, Miss Graythorpe. But you'll have to put
up with me." And the smile that spread over his whole face was so
like him now. Then came the allusion to <i>As You Like It</i>.</p>

<p>"I'll take you for pity, Mr.&nbsp;Palliser&mdash;'by my troth,' as my namesake
Rosalind, Celia's friend, in Shakespeare, says to what's his name
... Orlando...."</p>

<p>"Come, I say, Miss Graythorpe, that's not fair. It was Benedict said
it to Beatrice."</p>

<p>"Did he? And did Beatrice say she wouldn't waltz with him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, please! I'm so sorry. No&mdash;it wasn't Benedict&mdash;it <i>was</i>
Rosalind."</p>

<p>"That's right! Now let me button your glove for you. You'll be for
ever, with those big fingers." For both of us, thought Rosalind,
were determined to begin at once and not lose a minute. That dear
old time ... before...!</p>

<p>Then, even clearer still, came back to her the dim summer-dawn in
the garden, with here and there a Chinese lantern not burned out,
and the flagging music of the weary musicians afar, and she and
Gerry with the garden nearly to themselves. She could feel the cool
air of the morning again, and hear the crowing of a self-important
cock. And the informal wager which would live

<!-- Page 502 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
the longer&mdash;a Chinese
lantern at the point of death, or the vanishing moon just touching
the line of tree-tops against the sky, stirred by the morning wind.
And the voice of Gerry when return to the house and a farewell
became inevitable. She shut her eyes, and could hear it and her own
answer.</p>

<p>"I shall go to India in six weeks, and never see you again."</p>

<p>"Yes, you will; because Arthur Fenwick is to bring you round to
lawn-tennis...."</p>

<p>"That won't make having to go any better. And then when I come back,
in ever so many years, I shall find you...."</p>

<p>"Gone to kingdom come?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;married!... Oh no, do stop out&mdash;don't go in yet...."</p>

<p>"We ought to go in. Now, don't be silly."</p>

<p>"I can't help it.... Well!&mdash;a fellow I know asked a girl to marry
him he'd only known two hours."</p>

<p>"What very silly friends you must have, Mr.&nbsp;Palliser! Did she marry
him?"</p>

<p>"No! but they're engaged, and he's in Ceylon. But you wouldn't marry
me...."</p>

<p>"How on earth can you tell, in such a short time? What a goose you
are!... There!&mdash;the music's stopped, and Mrs.&nbsp;Nairn said that must
be the last waltz. Come along, or we shall catch it."</p>

<p>They had known each other exactly four hours!</p>

<p>Rosalind remembered it all, word for word. And how Gerry captured a
torn glove to keep; and when he came, as appointed, to lawn-tennis,
went back at once to Shakespeare, and said he had looked it up, and
it <i>was</i> Beatrice and Benedict, and not Rosalind at all. She could
remember, too, her weary and reproachful <i>chaperon</i>, and the
well-deserved scolding she got for the way she had been going on
with that young Palliser. Eight dances!</p>

<p>So long ago! And she could think through it all again. And to him it
had become a memory of shreds and patches. Let it remain so, or
become again oblivion&mdash;vanish with the rest of his forgotten past!
Her thought that it would do so was confidence itself as she sat
there waiting for his footstep on the stair. For had she not spoken
of herself unflinchingly as the girl who said those

<!-- Page 503 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
words from
Shakespeare, and had not her asseveration slipped from the mind that
could not receive it as water slips from oil? She could wait there
without misgiving&mdash;could even hope that, whatever it was due to,
this recent stirring of the dead bones of memory might mean nothing,
and die away leaving all as it was before.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Sally, acknowledging physical fatigue with reluctance, after her
long walk and swim in the morning, went to bed. It presented itself
to her as a thing practicable, and salutary in her state of
bewilderment, to lie in bed with her eyes closed, and think over the
events of the day. It would be really quiet. And then she would be
awake when Jeremiah came in, and would call out for information if
there was a sound of anything to hear about. But her project fell
through, for she had scarcely closed her eyes when she fell into a
trap laid for her by sleep&mdash;deep sleep, such as we fancy dreamless.
And when Fenwick came back she could not have heard his words to her
mother, even had they risen above the choking undertone in which he
spoke, nor her mother's reply, more audible in its sudden alarm, but
still kept down&mdash;for, startled as she was at Gerry's unexpected
words, she did not lose her presence of mind.</p>

<p>"What is it, Gerry darling? What is it, dear love? Has anything
happened? I'll come."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;come into my room. Come away from our girl. She mustn't hear."</p>

<p>She knew then at once that his past had come upon him somehow. She
knew it at once from the tone of his voice, but she could make no
guess as to the manner of it. She knew, too, that that heartquake
was upon her&mdash;the one she had felt so glad to stave off that day
upon the beach&mdash;and that self-command had to be found in an
emergency she might not have the strength to meet.</p>

<p>For the shock, coming as it did upon her false confidence&mdash;a sudden
thunderbolt from a cloudless sky&mdash;was an overwhelming one. She knew
she would have a moment's outward calm before her powers gave way,
and she must use it for Sally's security. What Gerry said was
true&mdash;their girl <i>must not</i> hear.</p>

<p>But oh, how quick thought travels! By the time Rosalind, after
stopping a second outside Sally's door, listening for any movement,

<!-- Page 504 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
had closed that of her husband's room as she followed him in,
placing the light she carried on a chair as she entered, she had
found in the words "our girl" a foretaste of water in the desert
that might be before her.</p>

<p>Another moment and she knew she was safe, so far as Gerry himself
went. As he had himself said, he would be the same Gerry to her and
she the same Rosey to him, whatever wild beast should leap out of
the past to molest them. She knew it was as he caught her to his
heart, crushing her almost painfully in the great strength that went
beyond his own control as he shook and trembled like an aspen-leaf
under the force of an emotion she could only, as yet, guess at the
nature of. But the guess was not a wrong one, in so far as it said
that each was there to be the other's shield and guard against ill,
past, present, and to come&mdash;a refuge-haven to fly to from every
tempest fate might have in store. She could not speak&mdash;could not
have found utterance even had words come to her. She could only rest
passive in his arms, inert and dumb, feeling in the short gasps that
caught his breath how he struggled for speech and failed, then
strove again. At last his voice came&mdash;short, spasmodic sentences
breaking or broken by like spans of silence:</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, my darling, remember!... remember!... whatever it
is ... it shall not come between us ... it shall not ... it <i>shall</i>
not.... Oh, my dear!... give me time, and I shall speak ... if I
could only say at once ... in one word ... could only understand ...
that is all ... to understand...." He relaxed his hold upon her; but
she held to him, or she might have fallen, so weak was she, and so
unsteady was the room and all in it to her sight. The image of him
that she saw seemed dim and in a cloud, as he pressed his hands upon
his eyes and stood for a moment speechless; then struggled again to
find words that for another moment would not come, caught in the
gasping of his breath. Then he got a longer breath, as for ease, and
drawing her face towards his own&mdash;and this time the touch of his
hand was tender as a child's&mdash;he kissed it repeatedly&mdash;kissed her
eyes, her cheeks, her lips. And in his kiss was security for her,
safe again in the haven of his love, come what might. She felt how
it brought back to her the breath she knew would fail her, unless
her heart, that had beaten so furiously a moment

<!-- Page 505 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
since, and then
died away, should resume its life. The room became steady, and she
saw his face and its pallor plainly, and knew that in a moment she
should find her voice. But he spoke first, again.</p>

<p>"That is what I want, dear love&mdash;to understand. Help me to
understand," he said. And then, as though feeling for the first time
how she was clinging to him for support, he passed his arm round her
gently, guiding her to sit down. But he himself remained standing by
her, as though physically unaffected by the storm of emotion,
whatever its cause, that had passed over him. Then Rosalind found
her voice.</p>

<p>"Gerry darling&mdash;let us try and get quiet over it. After all, we are
both here." As she said this she was not very clear about her own
meaning, but the words satisfied her. "I see you have remembered
more, but I cannot tell how much. Now try and tell me&mdash;have you
remembered <i>all</i>?"</p>

<p>"I think so, darling." He was speaking more quietly now, as one
docile to her influence. His manner gave her strength to continue.</p>

<p>"Since you left Mr.&nbsp;Pilkington&mdash;your friend at the hotel&mdash;didn't you
say the name Pilkington?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;there was no Pilkington! Oh yes, there was!&mdash;a friend of
Diedrich's...."</p>

<p>"Has it come back, I mean, since you left the house? Who is
Diedrich?"</p>

<p>"Stop a bit, dearest love! I shall be able to tell it all directly."
She, too, was glad of a lull, and welcomed his sitting down beside
her on the bed-end, drawing her face to his, and keeping it with the
hand that was not caressing hers. Presently he spoke again, more at
ease, but always in the undertone, just above a whisper, that meant
the consciousness of Sally, too, near. Rosalind said, "She won't
hear," and he replied, "No; it's all right, I think," and continued:</p>

<p>"Diedrich Kreutzkammer&mdash;he's Diedrich&mdash;don't you remember? Of course
you do!... I heard him down on the beach to-day singing. I wanted to
go to him at once, but I had to think of it first, so I came home.
Then I settled to go to him at the hotel. I had not remembered
anything then&mdash;anything to speak of&mdash;I had not remembered IT. Now it
is all back upon me,

<!-- Page 506 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
in a whirl." He freed the hand that held hers
for a moment, and pressed his fingers hard upon his eyes; then took
her hand again, as before. "I wanted to see the dear old fellow and
talk over old times, at 'Frisco and up at the Gold River&mdash;that, of
course! But I wanted, too, to make him repeat to me all the story I
had told him of my early marriage&mdash;oh, my darling!&mdash;<i>our</i> marriage,
and I did not know it! I know it now&mdash;I know it now."</p>

<p>Rosalind could feel the thrill that ran through him as his hand
tightened on hers. She spoke, to turn his mind for a moment. "How
came Baron Kreutzkammer at St.&nbsp;Sennans?"</p>

<p>"Diedrich? He has a married niece living at Canterbury. Don't you
remember? He told you and you told me...." Rosalind had forgotten
this, but now recalled it. "Well, we talked about the States&mdash;all
the story I shall have to tell you, darling, some time; but, oh
dear, how confused I get! <i>That</i> wasn't the first. The first was
telling him my story&mdash;the accident, and so on&mdash;and it was hard work
to convince him it was really me at Sonnenberg. That was rather a
difficulty, because I had sent him in the name I had in America, and
he only saw an old friend he thought was dead. All <i>that</i> was a
trifle; but, oh, the complications!..."</p>

<p>"What was the name you had in America?"</p>

<p>Fenwick answered musingly, "Harrisson," and then paused before
saying, "No, I had better not...." and leaving the sentence
unfinished. She caught his meaning, and said no more. After all, it
could matter very little if she never heard his American
experiences, and the name Harrisson had no association for her. She
left him to resume, without suggestion.</p>

<p>"He might have reminded me of anything that happened in the States,
and I should just have come back here and told it you, because, you
see, I should have been sure it was true, and no dream. It was
India. I had told him all, don't you see? And I got him to repeat
it, and then it all came back&mdash;all at once, the moment I saw it was
<i>you</i>, my darling&mdash;you yourself! It all became quite easy then. It
was <i>us</i>&mdash;you and me! I know it now&mdash;I know it now!"</p>

<p>"But, dearest, what made you see that it was us?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, because of the name! He told me all I had told

<!-- Page 507 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
him
from the beginning in German. We always spoke German. He could not
remember your first name, but he remembered your mother's&mdash;it had
stayed in his mind&mdash;because of the German word <i>Nachtigall</i> being so
nearly the same. As he said the word my mind got a frightful twist,
and I thought I was mad. I did, indeed, my dearest love&mdash;raving
mad!"</p>

<p>"And then you knew it?"</p>

<p>"And then I knew it. I nearly fainted clean off, and he went for
brandy; but I came round, and the dear old boy saw me to this door
here. It has all only just happened." He remained silent again for a
little space, holding her hand, and then said suddenly: "It <i>has</i>
happened, has it not? Is it all true, or am I dreaming?"</p>

<p>"Be patient, darling. It is all true&mdash;at least, I think so. It is
all true if it is like this, because remember, dear, you have told
me almost nothing.... I only know that it has come back to you that
I am Rosey and that you are Gerry&mdash;the old Rosey and Gerry long ago
in India...." She broke down over her own words, as her tears, a
relief in themselves, came freely, taxing her further to keep her
voice under for Sally's sake. It was only for a moment; then she
seemed to brush them aside in an effort of self-mastery, and again
began, dropping her voice even lower. "It is all true if it is like
this. I came out to marry you in India ... my darling!... and a
terrible thing happened to me on the way ... the story you know more
of now than I could tell you then ... for how <i>could</i> I tell it ...
think?..."</p>

<p>Her husband started up from her side gasping, beating his head like
a madman. She was in terror lest she had done wrong in her speech.
"Gerry, Gerry!" she appealed to him in a scarcely raised voice,
"think of Sally!" She rose and went to him, repeating, "Think of
Sally!" then drew him back to his former place. His breath went and
came heavily, and his forehead was drenched with sweat, as in
epilepsy; but the paroxysm left him as he sank back beside her,
saying only, "My God! that miscreant!" but showing that he had heard
her by the force of the constraint he put upon his voice. It gave
her courage to go on.</p>

<p>"I could not get it told then. I did not know the phrases&mdash;and you
were so happy, my darling&mdash;so happy when you met me at the station!
Oh, how could I? But I was wrong. I ought

<!-- Page 508 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
not to have let you marry
me, not knowing. And then ... it seemed deception, and I could not
right it...." Her voice broke again, as she hid her face on his
shoulder; but she knew her safety in the kiss she felt on her free
hand, and the gentleness of his that stroked her hair. Then she
heard his almost whispered words above her head, close to her ear:</p>

<p>"Darling, forgive me&mdash;forgive me! It was <i>I</i> that was in fault. I
might have known...."</p>

<p>"Gerry, dear ... no!..."</p>

<p>"Yes, I might. There was a woman there&mdash;had been an officer's wife.
She came to me and spoke rough truths about it&mdash;told me her notion
of the tale in her own language. 'Put her away from you,' she said,
'and you won't get another like her, and won't deserve her!' And she
was right, poor thing! But I was headstrong and obstinate, and would
not hear her. Oh, my darling, <i>how</i> we have paid for it!"</p>

<p>"But you have found me again, dear love!" He did not answer, but
raised up her face from his shoulder, parting the loose hair
tenderly&mdash;for it was all free on her shoulders&mdash;and gazing straight
into her eyes with an expression of utter bewilderment. "Yes,
darling, what is it?" said she, as though he had spoken.</p>

<p>"I am getting fogged!" he said, "and cannot make it out. Was it pure
accident? Surely something must have happened to bring it about."</p>

<p>"Bring what about?"</p>

<p>"How came we to find each other again, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I see! Pure accident, I should say, dear! Why not? It would not
have happened if it had not been possible. Thank God it did!"</p>

<p>"Thank God it did! But think of the strangeness of it all! How came
Sally in that train?"</p>

<p>"Why not, darling? Where else could she have been? She was coming
back to tea, as usual."</p>

<p>"And she put me in a cab&mdash;bless her!&mdash;she and Conrad Vereker&mdash;and
brought me home to you. But did you know me at once, darling?"</p>

<p>"At once."</p>

<p>"But why didn't you tell me?"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 509 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"If you had shown the slightest sign of knowing me I should have
told you, and taken my chance; but you only looked at me and smiled,
and never knew me! Was mine a good plan? At least, it has answered."
A clasp and a kiss was the reply. She was glad that he should choose
the line of conversation, and did not break into the pause that
followed. The look of fixed bewilderment on his face was painful,
but she did not dare any suggestion of guidance to his mind. She had
succeeded but ill before in going back to the cause of their own
early severance. Yet that was what she naturally had most at heart,
and longed to speak of. Could she have chosen, she would have liked
to resume it once for all, in spite of the pain&mdash;to look the
dreadful past in the face, and then agree to forget it together. She
was hungry to tell him that even when he broke away from her that
last time she saw him at Umballa&mdash;broke away from her so roughly
that his action had all the force and meaning of a blow&mdash;she only
saw <i>his</i> image of the wrong she had done, or seemed to have done
him; that she had nothing for him through it all but love and
forgiveness. At least, she would have tried to make sure that he had
been able to connect and compare the tale she had told him since
their reunion with his new memory of the facts of twenty years ago.
But she dared say nothing further as yet. For his part, at this
moment, he seemed strangely willing to let all the old story lapse,
and to dwell only on the incredible chance that had brought them
again together. All that eventful day our story began with had
leaped into the foreground of his mind.</p>

<p>Presently he said, still almost whispering hoarsely, with a constant
note of amazement and something like panic in his voice: "If it
hadn't happened&mdash;the accident&mdash;I suppose I should have gone back to
the hotel. And what should I have done next? I should never have
found you and Sally...."</p>

<p>"Were you poor, Gerry darling?"</p>

<p>"Frightfully rich! Gold-fields, mining-place up the Yu-kon. Near the
Arctic Circle." He went on in a rapid undertone, as if he were
trying to supply briefly what he knew the woman beside him must be
yearning to know, if not quite unlike other women. "I wasn't well
off before&mdash;didn't get on at the Bar at St.&nbsp;Louis&mdash;but not poor
exactly. Then I made a small pile cattle-ranching in Texas, and
somehow went to live at Quebec. There

<!-- Page 510 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
were a lot of French
Canadians I took to. Then after that, 'Frisco and the gold...."</p>

<p>"Gerry dear!"</p>

<p>"Yes, love, what?"</p>

<p>"Have you any relations living in England?"</p>

<p>"Heaps, but I haven't spoken to one of them for years and years&mdash;not
since <i>then</i>. One of them's a Bart. with a fungus on his nose in
Shropshire. He's an uncle. Then there's my sister, if she's not
dead&mdash;my sister Livy. She's Mrs.&nbsp;Huxtable. I fancy they all think
I'm dead in the bush in Australia. I had a narrow squeak there...."</p>

<p>"Now, Gerry darling, I'll tell you what I want you to do...."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I will."</p>

<p>"You can't tell me all these things now, and you'll be ill; so lie
down on the bed there, and I'll sit by you till you go to sleep. Or
look, you get to bed comfortably, and I'll be back in a few minutes
and sit by you. Just till you go off. Now do as I tell you."</p>

<p>He obeyed like a child. It was wonderful how, in the returning power
of her self-command, she took him, as it were, in hand, and rescued
him from the tension of his bewilderment. Apart from the fact that
the fibre of her nature was exceptionally strong, her experience of
this last hour had removed the most part of the oppression that had
weighed her down for more than a twelvemonth&mdash;the doubt as to which
way a discovery of his past would tell on her husband's love for
her. She had no feeling now but anxiety on his behalf, and this
really helped her towards facing the situation calmly. All things do
that take us out of ourselves.</p>

<p>She stood again a moment outside Sally's door to make sure she was
not moving, then went to her own room, not sorry to be alone. She
wanted a pause for the whirl in her brain to stop, for the torrent
of new event that had rushed in upon it to find its equilibrium. If
Gerry fell asleep before she returned to him so much the better! She
did not even light her candle, preferring to be in the dark.</p>

<p>But this did not long defer her return to her husband's room. A very
few minutes in the darkness and the silence of her own were enough
for her, and she was grateful for both. Then she went back, to find
him in bed, sitting up and pressing his fingers on

<!-- Page 511 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>
his eyes, as one
does when suffering from nervous headache. But he disclaimed any
such feeling in answer to her inquiry. She sat down beside him,
holding his hand, just as she had done in the night of the storm,
and begged him for her sake and his own to try to sleep. It would
all seem so much easier and clearer in the morning.</p>

<p>Yes, he would sleep, he said. And, indeed, he had resolved to affect
sleep, so as to induce her to go away herself and rest. But it was
not so easy. Half-grasped facts went and came&mdash;recollections that he
knew he should before long be able to marshal in their proper order
and make harmonious. For the time being, though they had not the
nightmare character of the recurrences he had suffered from before
his memory-revival, they stood between him and sleep effectually.
But he could and would simulate sleep directly, for Rosalind's sake.
He had looked at his watch and seen that it was near two in the
morning. Yes, he would sleep; but he must ask one question, or lose
his reason if she left him alone with it unanswered.</p>

<p>"Rosey darling!"</p>

<p>"What, dearest?"</p>

<p>"We'll forget the old story, won't we, and only think of <i>now</i>?
That's the right way to take it, isn't it?"</p>

<p>She kissed his face as she answered, just as she might have kissed a
child. "Quite right, dear love," she said; "and now go to sleep. Or
if you must talk a little more, talk about Conrad and Sally."</p>

<p>"Ah yes!" he answered; "that's all happiness. Conrad and Sally! But
there's a thing...."</p>

<p>"What thing, dear? What is it?"</p>

<p>"I shall ask it you in the end, so why not now?" She felt in his
hand a shudder that ran through him, as his hold on her fingers
tightened.</p>

<p>"So why not now?" she repeated after him. "Why hesitate?"</p>

<p>The tremor strengthened in her hand and was heard in his voice
plainly as he answered with an effort: "What became of the baby?"</p>

<p>"What became of the baby!" There was a new terror in Rosalind's
voice as she repeated the words&mdash;a fear for his reason. "What baby?"</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 512 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"<i>The</i> baby&mdash;<i>his</i> baby&mdash;<i>his</i> horrible baby!"</p>

<p>"Gerry darling! Gerry <i>dearest</i>! do think...." His puzzled eyes,
bloodshot in his white face, turned full upon her; but he remained
silent, waiting to hear more. "You have forgotten, darling," she
said quietly.</p>

<p>His free hand that lay on the coverlid clenched, and a spasm caught
his arm, as though it longed for something to strike or strangle.
"No, no!" said he; "I am all right. I mean that damned monster's
baby. There <i>was</i> a baby?" His voice shook on these last words as
though he, too, had a fear for his own reason. His face flushed as
he awaited her reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gerry darling! but you <i>have</i> forgotten. His baby was Sally&mdash;my
Sallykin!"</p>

<p>For it was absolutely true that, although he had as complete a
knowledge, in a certain sense, of Sally's origin as the well-coached
student has of the subject he is to answer questions in, he had
forgotten it under the stress of his mental trial as readily as the
student forgets what his mind has only acquiesced in for its
purpose, in his joy at recovering his right to ignorance. Sally had
an existence of her own quite independent of her origin. She was his
and Rosalind's&mdash;a part of <i>their</i> existence, a necessity. It was
easy and natural for him to dissociate the living, breathing reality
that filled so much of their lives from its mere beginnings. It was
less easy for Rosalind, but not an impossibility altogether, helped
by the forgiveness for the past that grew from the soil of her
daughter's love.</p>

<p>"You <i>had</i> forgotten, dear," she repeated; "but you know now."</p>

<p>"Yes, I had forgotten, because of Sally herself; but she is <i>my</i>
daughter now...."</p>

<p>She waited, expecting him to say more; but he did not speak again.
As soon as he was, or seemed to be, asleep, she rose quietly and
left him.</p>

<p>She was so anxious that no trace of the tempest that had passed over
her should be left for Sally to see in the morning that she got as
quickly as possible to bed; and, with a little effort to
tranquillise her mind, soon sank into a state of absolute oblivion.
It was the counterswing of the pendulum&mdash;Nature's protest against a
strain beyond her powers to bear, and its remedy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV"></a>CHAPTER XLIV</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF A CONTRACT JOB FOR REPAIRS. HOW FENWICK HAD ANOTHER SLEEPLESS
NIGHT AFTER ALL. WHICH IS WHICH, NOW OR TWENTY ODD YEARS AGO? HOW
SALLY FOLLOWED JEREMIAH OUT. WHAT A LOT OF TALK ABOUT A LIFE-BELT!</p>

<p>A colourless dawn chased a grey twilight from the sea and white
cliffs of St.&nbsp;Sennans, and a sickly effort of the sun to rise
visibly, ending above a cloud-bank in a red half-circle that seemed
a thing quite unconnected with the struggling light, was baffled by
a higher cloud-bank still that came discouragingly from the west,
and quenched the hopes of the few early risers who were about as St.
Sennans tower chimed six. The gull that flew high above the green
waste of white-flecked waters was whiter still against the inky blue
of the cloud-curtain that had disallowed the day, and the paler
vapour-drifts that paused and changed and lost themselves and died;
but the air that came from the sea was sweet and mild for the time
of year, and the verdict of the coastguardsman at the flagstaff, who
in pursuance of his sinecure had seen the night out, was that the
day was pretty sure to be an uncertain sart, with little froshets on
the water, like over yander. He seemed to think that a certainty of
uncertainty had all the value of a forecast, and was as well
satisfied with his report as he was that he had not seen a smuggler
through the telescope he closed as he uttered it.</p>

<p>"Well, I should judge it might be fairly doubtful," was the reply of
the man he was speaking with. It was the man who had "Elinor" and
"Bessie" tattooed on his arm. They were not legible now, as a couple
of life-belts, or hencoops, as they are sometimes called, hung over
the arm and hid them. The boy Benjamin was with his father, and
carried a third. An explanation of them came in answer to
interrogation in the eye of the coastguard. "Just to put a touch of
new paint on 'em against the weather." The speaker made one movement
of his head say that

<!-- Page 514 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
they had come from the pier-end, and another
that he had taken them home to repaint by contract.</p>

<p>"What do you make out of S.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;C.?" the coastguard asked, scarcely
as one who had no theory himself, more as one arch&aelig;ologist
addressing another, teeming with deference, but ready for
controversy. The other answered with some paternal pride:</p>

<p>"Ah, there now! Young Benjamin, he made <i>that</i> good, and asked for
to make it red in place of black himself! Didn't ye, ye young
sculping? St.&nbsp;Sennans Pier Company, that's all it comes to, followed
out. But I'm no great schoolmaster myself, and that's God's truth."
Both contemplated the judicious restoration with satisfaction; and
young Benjamin, who had turned purple under publicity, murmured that
it was black afower. He didn't seem to mean anything, but to think
it due to himself to say something, meaning or no. The
coastguardsman merely said, "Makes a tidy job!" and the father and
son went on their way to the pier.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour before, this coastguard had looked after the
visitor in a blue serge suit up at Lobjoit's, who had passed him
going briskly towards the fishing-quarter. He had recognised him
confidently, for he knew Fenwick well, and saw nothing strange in
his early appearance. Now that he saw him returning, and could take
full note of him, he almost suspected he had been mistaken, so wild
and pallid was the face of this man, who, usually ready with a light
word for every chance encounter&mdash;even with perfect strangers&mdash;now
passed him by ungreeted, and to all seeming unconscious of his
presence. The coastguard was for a moment in doubt if he should not
follow him, inferring something in the nature of delirium from his
aspect; but seeing that he made straight for the pier, and knowing
that young Benjamin's father was more familiar with him than
himself, he was contented to record in thought that that was a face
with a bad day ahead, and leave it.</p>

<p>For Gerry, when Rosalind left him, was rash in assuming he could let
her do so safely. His well-meant pretext of sleep was not destined
to grow into a reality. He had really believed that it would, so
soothing was the touch of her hand in his own. The moment he was
alone his mind leapt, willy-nilly, to the analysis of one point or
other in the past that had just come back to him. He

<!-- Page 515 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
tried to
silence thought, and to sleep, knowing that his best hope was in
rest; but each new effort only ended in his slipping back to what he
had just dismissed. And that terrible last interview with Rosey at
Umballa, when he parted from her, as he thought, never to see her
again, was the Rome to which all the roads of recollection led. Each
involuntary visit there had its <i>rench&eacute;rissement</i> on the previous
one, and in the end the image of that hour became a
brain-oppression, and wrote the word "fever" large on the tablets of
his apprehension.</p>

<p>He knew now it was not to be sleep; he knew it as he sat up in bed
feeling his pulse, and stimulating it with his anxiety that it
should go slow. Was there nothing he could take that would make him
sleep? Certainly he knew of nothing, anywhere, except it was to be
found by waking Rosalind, probably sound asleep by now. Out of the
question! Oh, why, why, with all the warning he had had, had he
neglected to provide himself with a mysterious thing known to him
all his life as a soothing-draught? It would have been so useful
now, and Conrad would have defined it down to the prosaic
requirements of pharmacy. But it was too late!</p>

<p>So long as her hand was in his, so long as her lips were near his
own, what did it matter what he recollected? The living present
cancelled the dead past. But to be there alone in the dark, with the
image of that Rosalind of former years clinging to him, and crying
for forgiveness because his mind, warped against her by a false
conception of the truth, could not forgive; to be defenceless
against her last words, coming through the long interval to him
again just as he heard them, twenty years ago, bringing back the
other noises of the Indian night&mdash;the lowing of the bullocks in the
compound, the striking of the hour on the Kutcherry gongs, the
grinding of the Persian wheels unceasingly drawing water for the
irrigation of the fields&mdash;to be exposed to this solitude and
ever-growing imagination was to become the soil for a self-sown crop
of terrors&mdash;fear of fever, fear of madness, fear at the very least
of perturbation such that Sally might come, through it, to a
knowledge that had to be kept from her at all costs.</p>

<p>He lighted his candle with a cautious match, and found what might be
a solace&mdash;a lucky newspaper of the morning. If only he could read it
without audible rustling, unheard by the sleepers!</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 516 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
</div>

<p>The print was almost too small to be read by the light of a single
candle; but there were the usual headings, the usual ranks of
capitals that tell us so quick that there is nothing we shall care
about in the pale undecipherable paragraphs below, and that we have
spent our halfpenny in vain. There was the usual young lady who had
bought, or was trying on, a large hat, and whose top-story above, in
profile, had got so far ahead of her other stories below. There were
the consignments of locust-flights of boots, for this young lady's
friends, with heels in the instep. And all the advertisements that
some one <i>must</i> believe, or they would not pay for insertion; but
that <i>we</i> ignore, incredulous. Fenwick tried hard, for his own sake,
to make the whole thing mean something, but his dazed brain and
feverish eyes refused to respond to his efforts, and he let the
paper go, and gave himself up, a prey to his own memories. After
all, the daylight was sure to come in the end to save him.</p>

<p>He tried hard to reason with himself, to force himself to feel the
reality of his own belief that all was well; for he had no doubt of
it, as an abstract truth. It was the power of getting comfort from
it that was wanting. If only his heart could stop thumping and his
brain burning, <i>he</i> would have done the rejoicing that Rosalind was
there, knowing all he knew, and loving him; that Sally was there,
loving him too, but knowing nothing, and needing to know nothing;
that one of his first greetings in the day to come would be from
Conrad Vereker, probably too much intoxicated with his own happiness
to give much attention to what he was beginning to acknowledge was
some kind of physical or nervous fever. If he could only sleep!</p>

<p>But he could not&mdash;could hardly close his eyes. He said to himself
again and again that nothing was the matter; that, if anything, he
and Rosey were better off than they had been yet; that they had
passed through a land of peril to a great deliverance. But he did
not believe his own assurance, and the throng of memories that his
feverish condition would not let sleep, or that were its cause, came
on him more and more thickly through all those hours of the dreary
night. They came, too, with a growing force, each one as it returned
having more the character of a waking dream, vivid almost to the
point of reality. But all ended alike. He always found himself
breaking away from

<!-- Page 517 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
Rosey in the veranda in the bungalow at Umballa,
and could hear again her cry of despair: "Oh, Gerry, Gerry! It is
not as you think. Oh, stay, stay! Give me a chance to show you how I
love you!" The tramp of his horse as he rode away from his home and
that white figure left prostrate in the veranda above him, became a
real sound that beat painfully upon his ears; and the voice of the
friend he sought&mdash;an old soldier in camp at Sabatoo, where he rode
almost without a halt&mdash;as he roused him in the dawn of the next day,
came to him again almost as though spoken in the room beside him:
"Left <i>your</i> wife, Palliser! My God, sir! what's to come next?" And
then the wicked hardness of his own heart, and his stubborn refusal
to listen to the angry remonstrance that followed. "I tell you this,
young man! the man's a fool&mdash;a damned fool&mdash;that runs from the woman
who loves him!" And the asseveration that the speaker would say the
same if she was anything short of the worst character in camp, only
in slightly different words. His remorse for his own obduracy, and
the cruelty of his behaviour then; his shame when he thought of his
application, months later, to the Court at Lahore&mdash;for "relief" from
Rosey: just imagine it!&mdash;these were bad enough to think back on,
even from the point of view of his previous knowledge; but how
infinitely worse when he thought what she had been to him, how she
had acted towards him two years ago!</p>

<p>Even the painful adventure he could now look back to clearly, and
with a rather amused interest, as to an event with no laceration in
it&mdash;his wandering in an Australian forest, for how many days he
could not say, and his final resurrection at a town a hundred miles
from his starting-point&mdash;even this led him back in the end to the
old story. The whole passed through his mind like the scenes of a
drama&mdash;his confidence, having lost the track, that his horse, left
to himself, would find it again; his terror when, coming back from a
stone's-throw off, he found the tree deserted he had tied his horse
to; his foolish starting off to catch him, when the only sane course
was to wait for his return. But the second act of the drama took his
mind again to Rosey in her loneliness; for when he was found by a
search-party at the foot of a telegraph-post he had used his last
match to burn down, he was inarticulate, and seemed to give his name
as Harrisson. As he

<!-- Page 518 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
slowly recovered sense and speech at the
telegraph-station&mdash;for the interruption of the current had been his
cry for help to its occupants&mdash;he heard himself addressed by the
name and saw the mistake; but he did not correct it, being, indeed,
not sorry for an incognito, sick of his life, as it were, and glad
to change his identity. But how if Rosey wrote to him then&mdash;think of
it!&mdash;under his old name? Fancy <i>her</i> when the time came for a
possible reply, with who could say what of hope in it! Fancy her
many decisions that it was still too soon for an answer, followed by
as many others as time went on that it was not too late! If he had
received such a letter from her then, might it not all have been
different? May she not have written one? He had talked so little
with her; nothing forbade the idea. And so his mind travelled round
with monotonous return, always to that old time, and those old
scenes, and all the pain of them.</p>

<p>It was curious&mdash;he noted the oddity himself&mdash;that his whole life in
America took the drama character, and <i>he</i> became the spectator. He
never caught himself playing his own part over again, with all its
phases of passion or excitement, as in the earlier story. In that,
his identification of himself with his past grew and grew, and as
his fever increased through the small hours of the morning, got more
and more the force of a waking dream. And when the dawn came at
last, and the gleam from the languid sun followed it, the man who
got up and looked out towards its great blue bank of cloud was only
half sure he was not another former self, looking out towards
another sea, twenty years ago, to see if he could identify the ship
that was to take him from Kurachi to Port Jackson.</p>

<p>What did it all mean? Yes, sure enough he had taken his passage, and
to-morrow leagues of sea would lie between him and Rosey. That would
end it for ever. No reconciliations, no repentance then!... Was
there not still time? a chance if he chose to catch at it? Puny
irresolution! Shake it all off, and have done with it.... He
shuddered as he thought through his old part again, and then came
back with a jerk to the strange knowledge that he was opening a
closed book, a tragedy written twenty years ago; and that there,
within a few feet of where he gazed with a jaded sight out to the
empty sea, was Rosey herself, alive and breathing; and in an hour or
two he was to see her, feel

<!-- Page 519 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
the touch of her hand and lips, be his
happy self again of three days only gone by, if he could but face
masterfully the strange knowledge this mysterious revival of a
former self had brought upon him. And there was Sally....</p>

<p>But at the name, as it came to his mind, came also the shock of
another mystery&mdash;who and what was Sally?</p>

<p>Let him lie down again and try to think quietly. Was not this part
of his delirium? Could he have got the story right? Surely! Was it
not of her that Rosey had said, only a few hours since, "<i>His</i> baby
was Sally&mdash;<i>my</i> Sallykin"? And was he not then able to reply
collectedly and with ease, "She is <i>my</i> daughter now," and to feel
the power of his choice that it should be so? But the strength of
Rosalind was beside him then, and now he was here alone. He beat
off&mdash;fought against&mdash;that hideous fatherhood of Sally's that he
could not bear, that image that he felt might drive him mad. Oh,
villain, villain! Far, far worse to him was&mdash;perforce must be&mdash;this
miscreant's crime than that mere murder that shook Hamlet's reason
to its foundation. He dared not think of it lest he should cry out
aloud. But, patience! Only two or three hours more, and Rosalind
would be there to help him to bear it.... What a coward's
thought!&mdash;to help him to bear what she herself had borne in silence
for twenty years!</p>

<p>Would he not be better up, now that it was light? Of course! But how
be sure he should not wake them?</p>

<p>Well, the word was caution; he must be very quiet about it, that was
all. He slipped on his clothes without washing&mdash;it always makes a
noise&mdash;ran a comb through the tangled hair his pillow-tossings of
four hours had produced, and got away stealthily without accident,
or meeting any early riser, speech with whom would have betrayed
him.</p>

<p>He had little trouble with the door-fastenings, that often perplex
us in a like case, blocking egress with mysterious mechanisms.
Housebreakers were rare in St.&nbsp;Sennans. He had more fear his
footsteps would be audible; but it seemed not, and he walked away
towards the cliff pathway unnoticed.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>The merpussy waked to a consciousness of happiness undefined, a
sense of welcome to the day. What girl would not have done so, under
her circumstances? For Sally had no doubt in her mind

<!-- Page 520 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
of her own
satisfaction at the outcome of yesterday. She might have treated the
feelings and experience of other lovers&mdash;regular ones, prone to
nonsense&mdash;with contempt, but she never questioned the advantages of
her own position as compared with theirs. Her feast was better
cooked, altogether more substantial and real than the kickshaws and
sweetmeats she chose to ascribe to the <i>menus</i> of Arcadia.
Naturally; because see what a much better sort Conrad was! It was
going to be quite a different kind of thing this time. And as for
the old Goody, she was not half bad. Nothing was half bad in Sally's
eyes that morning, and almost everything was wholly good.</p>

<p>She had slept so sound she was sure it was late. But it was only
half-past six, and the early greetings of Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit below were
not to the baker, nor even to the milk, but to next door, which was
dealing with the question of its mat and clean step through the
agency of its proprietress, whose voice chimed cheerfully with Mrs.
Lobjoit's over the surprise of the latter finding <i>her</i> street door
had been opened, and that some one had already passed out. For Mrs.
Lobjoit had made <i>that</i> sure, the night before, that she had "shot
to" the bottom bolt that <i>would</i> shet, <i>because</i> she had ignored as
useless the top bolt that <i>wouldn't</i> shet&mdash;the correlation of events
so often appealed to by witnesses under examination; which Law,
stupidly enough, prides itself on snubbing them for. Further, Mrs.
Lobjoit would have flown to the solution that it was her gentleman
gone out, only that it was quite into the night before they stopped
from talking.</p>

<p>Sally heard this because she had pulled down the top sash of her
window to breathe the sea air, regardless of the fact she well knew,
and described thus&mdash;that the sash-weight stuck and clunkled and
wouldn't come down. She decided against running the risk of
disturbing Jeremiah on the strength of Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit's impressions;
although, if he had gone out, she certainly would follow him. But
she slipped on a dressing-gown and went half-way downstairs, to see
if his hat was still on its peg. It was gone. So she went back to
her room, and dressed furtively. Because if they <i>had</i> been talking
late into the night, it would be just as well for her mother to have
her sleep out.</p>

<p>But she had hardly finished washing when she became aware of a
footstep outside&mdash;Jeremiah's certainly. She went to the window,

<!-- Page 521 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
saw
him approach the house, look up at it, but as though he did not
recognise that she was there, and then turn away towards the
flagstaff and the old town. It was odd and unlike him, and Sally was
alarmed. Besides, how white he looked!</p>

<p>Bear this in mind, that Sally knew absolutely nothing of the
cataclysm of revived memory in Jeremiah. Remember that the incident
of the galvanic battery at the pier-end is only four days old. Do
not be misled by the close details we have given of these four days.</p>

<p>Sally's alarm at the haggard look of her stepfather's face took away
her breath; at least, she did not find her voice soon enough for him
to hear her call out&mdash;she did not like to shout loud because of her
mother&mdash;as he turned away. Or it seemed so, for that was the only
way she could account for his walking away so abruptly. In her hurry
to get dressed and follow him, she caught up an undergarment that
lay on the floor, without seeing that her own foot was on the tape
that was to secure it, and a rip and partial disruption was the
consequence. Never mind, it would hold up till she came in. Or, if
it didn't, where was that safety-pin that was on her dressing-table
yesterday? Not there? Again, never mind! She would do, somehow. She
hurried on her clothes, and her hat and waterproof, and left the
house, going quickly on what she supposed to be the track of
Jeremiah, who was, by now, no longer visible.</p>

<p>But she caught sight of him returning, while she was still two or
three minutes' walk short of the flagstaff he was approaching from
the other side. He would stop to talk with the coastguard. He always
did. Surely he would, this time. But no&mdash;he didn't.</p>

<p>He may have spoken, but he did not stop. So Sally noted as she
hesitated an instant, seeing him turn off at an angle and go towards
the pier. There was a shorter cut to the pier, without going to the
flagstaff. Sally turned herself, and took it. She would catch him as
he came back from the pier-end, if he was going to walk along it.</p>

<p>She saw him as she descended the slope that, part pathway and part
steps, led down towards the sea. He walked straight towards the
pier, passing as he went a man and boy, who were carrying what she
took, at that distance, for well-made coils of rope; and then,
arriving at the pier-turnstile just as they did, pass them, and,

<!-- Page 522 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
leaving them apparently in conversation with the gatekeeper, walk
steadily on towards the pier-end.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>"I shouldn't call the paint properly hardened on myself. Nor won't
be yet-a-piece, if you ask my opinion." It was young Benjamin's
father said these words to the veteran in charge of the
pier-turnstile; who, as an early bird, was counting his tickets, so
to speak, before they were hatched&mdash;his actual professional
cabinet-s&eacute;ance not having begun. For the pier wasn't open yet, and
his permission to Fenwick to pass the open side-gate was an
indulgence to an acquaintance.</p>

<p>His reply to the speaker was that he must bide awhile in patience,
then. Paint was good to dry while the grass grew, and there was
plenty else to fret about for them as wanted it. He seemed only to
mention this from consideration of the wants of others. He either
had plenty to fret about, or was happier without anything. He ended
with, "What have you to say to that, Jake Tracy?" showing that the
father of Benjamin was Jacob, following precedent.</p>

<p>But Jacob preferred not to be led away into ethics. "I should stand
'em by, in the shadow, for the matter of a day or two," said he. "In
yander." And the life-belts being safely disposed of, he added: "I
thought to carry back number fower from the pier-end, and make a
finish of the job. But looking to the condition of this paint, maybe
better leave her for service. She'll do as well next week." But the
moralist inclined to make a finish of the job. Who was going
overboard afore the end of next week? And supposing they did, the
resources of civilisation wouldn't be exhausted, for we could throw
'em a clean one paint or no.</p>

<p>"Send your lad to fetch her along, Jake. I'll make myself
answerable." And young Benjamin, confirmed by a nod from his father,
departed for the mysteriously feminine hencoop.</p>

<p>Just as the boy turned to go, Fenwick came up, and, paying no
attention to greetings from the two men, passed through the
side-gate and walked rather briskly away along the pier. Each of the
men looked at the other, as though asking a question. But neither
answered, and then both said, "Queer, too!" A nascent discussion of
whether one or other should not follow him&mdash;for the look of his face
had gone home to both, as he was, of course, well

<!-- Page 523 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
known to
them&mdash;was cut short by Jacob Tracy saying, "Here's his daughter
coming to see for him." And, just after, Sally had passed them,
leaving them pleasantly stirred by the bright smile and eye-flash
that seemed this morning brighter than ever. The boy shouted
something from the pier-end, to which his father's shouted reply was
that he must bide a minute and he would come to see himself.</p>

<p>"The yoong beggar's got the use of his eyes," he said, not hurrying.
"I'll go bail he'll find her. She's there all right, I suppose?" He
was still referring to the hencoop, not to any lady.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>she's</i> there, quite safe. You'd best step along and find her.
Boys are boys, when all's told."</p>

<p>But Jacob wanted Benjamin to distinguish himself, and still didn't
hurry. The strange appearance of Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit's gentleman supplied
materials for chat. Presently his son shouted again, and he
answered, "Not there, is she? I'll come." He walked away towards the
pier-end just as Sally, who had fancied Jeremiah would be somewhere
alongside of the pagoda-building that nearly covered it, came back
from her voyage of exploration, and looked down the steps to the
under-platform, that young Benjamin had just come up shouting.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLV" id="CHAPTER_XLV"></a>CHAPTER XLV</h2>

<p class="subhead">OF CONRAD VEREKER'S REVISION OF PARADISE, AND OF FENWICK'S HIGH
FEVER. OF AN ENGLISH OFFICER WHO WAVERED AT BOMBAY, AND OF FENWICK'S
SURPRISE-BATH IN THE BRITISH CHANNEL. WHY HE DID NOT SINK. THE ELLEN
JANE OF ST. SENNANS. ONLY SALLY IS IN THE WATER STILL. MORE BOATS.&nbsp;FOUND!</p>

<p>Fenwick, haunted by the phantoms of his own past&mdash;always, as his
fever grew, assuming more and more the force of realities&mdash;but
convinced of their ephemeral nature, and that the crisis of this
fever would pass and leave him free, had walked quickly along the
sea front towards the cliff pathway. Had Dr.&nbsp;Conrad seen him as he
passed below his window and looked up at it, he would probably have
suspected something and followed him. And then the events of this
story would have travelled a different road. But Vereker, possessed
by quite another sort of delirium, had risen even earlier&mdash;almost
with the dawn&mdash;and, taking Sally's inaccessibility at that unearthly
hour for granted, had gone for a long walk over what was now to him
a land of enchantment&mdash;the same ground he and Sally had passed over
on the previous evening. He and his mother would be on their way to
London in a few hours, and he would like to see the landmarks that
were to be a precious memory for all time yet once more while he had
the chance. Who could say that he would ever visit St.&nbsp;Sennans
again?</p>

<p>If Fenwick, in choosing this direction first, had a half-formed idea
of attracting the doctor's attention, the appearance of Mrs.
Iggulden's shuttered parlour-window would have discouraged him. It
told a tale of a household still asleep, and quite truly as far as
she herself was concerned. For Dr.&nbsp;Conrad, as might have been
expected, was very late in coming home the night before; and his
mother's peculiarity of not being able to sleep if kept up till
eleven, combined with the need of a statement of her position, a
declaration of policy, and almost a budget, if

<!-- Page 525 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
not quite, on the
subject of her son's future housekeeping, having resulted in what
threatened to become an all-night sitting, the good woman's dozes
and repentances, with jerks, on the stairs overnight, had produced
their consequences in the morning. Fenwick passed the house, and
walked on as far as where the path rose to the cliffs; then turned
back, and, pausing a moment, as we have seen, under Sally's window,
failed in his dreamy state to see her as she looked over the
cross-bar at him, and then went on towards the old town. It may be
she was not very visible; the double glasses of an open sash-window
are almost equal to opacity. But even with that, the extreme
aberration of Fenwick's mind at the moment is the only way to
account for his not seeing her.</p>

<p>In fact, his mental perturbation came and went by gusts, as his
memory caught at or relinquished agitating points of reminiscence,
always dwelling on that parting from Rosalind at Umballa. His brain
and nervous system were in a state that involved a climax and
reaction; and, unhappily, this climax, during which his
identification of his present self with his memory of its past was
intensified to the point of absolute hallucination, came at an
inopportune moment. If he could only have kept the phantoms of his
imagination at bay until he met Sally! But, really, speculation on
so strange a frame of mind is useless; we can only accept the facts
as they stand.</p>

<p>He had no recollection afterwards of what followed when he passed
the house and failed to see Sally or hear her call out to him. For
the time being he was back again in his life of twenty years ago.
Those who find this hard to believe may see no way of accounting for
what came about but by ascribing to Fenwick an intention of suicide.
For our part we believe him to have been absolutely incapable of
such an act from a selfish impulse; and, moreover, it is absurd to
impute to him such a motive, at this time, however strongly he might
have been impelled towards it by discovering the injustice and
cruelty of his own unforgiveness towards his young wife at some
previous time&mdash;as, for instance, in America&mdash;when she herself was
beyond his reach, and a recantation of his error impossible. Unless
we accept his conduct as the result of a momentary dementia,
produced by overstrain, it must remain inexplicable.</p>

<!-- Page 526 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
</div>

<p>It appeared to him, so far as he was afterwards able to define or
record it, that he was no longer walking on the familiar track
between the few lodging-houses that made up the old St.&nbsp;Sennans, and
the still older fishing-quarter near the jetty, but that he was
again on his way from Lahore to Kurachi, from which he was to embark
for a new land where his broken heart might do its best to heal; for
if ever a man was utterly broken-hearted it was he when he came away
from Lahore, after his futile attempt to procure a divorce. He no
longer saw the cold northern sea under its great blue cloud-curtain
that had shrouded the coming day; nor the line of fishing-smacks,
beached high and dry, and their owners' dwellings near at hand, a
little town of tar and timber in behind the stowage-huts of nets and
tackle, nor the white escarpment of the cliffs beyond, that the sea
had worked so many centuries to plunder from the rounded pastures of
the sheep above. He no longer heard the music of the waves on the
shingle, nor the cry of the sea-bird that swept over them, nor the
tinkle of the sheep-bell the wind knows how to carry so far in the
stillness of the morning, nor the voices of the fisher-children
playing in the boats that one day may bear them to their death. His
mind was far away in the Indian heat, parching and suffocated on the
long railway journey from Lahore to Kurachi, scarcely better when he
had reached his first boat that was to take him to Bombay, to embark
again a day or two later for Australia. How little he had forgotten
of the short but tedious delay in that chaotic emporium of all
things European and Asiatic, that many-coloured meeting-ground of a
thousand nationalities! How little, that the whole should come back
to him now, and fill his brain with its reality, till the living
present grew dim and vanished; reviving now and again, as fiction,
read in early years, revives with a suggested doubt&mdash;is it true or
false?</p>

<p>He sat again on the Esplanade at Bombay, as the sun vanished in a
flood of rosy gold, and released the world from his heat. He felt
again the relief of the evening wind; heard again the chat of a
group of English officers who sipped sherry-cobblers at a table a
few paces off. "I always change my mind," said one of them,
"backwards and forwards till the last minute; then I make it the
last one." He quite understood this man's speech, and

<!-- Page 527 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
thought how
like himself! For from the time he left Lahore he, too, had gone
backwards and forwards, now resolving to return, come what might,
now telling himself firmly there was no remedy but in distance
apart, and all there might be of oblivion. Was there not yet time?
He could still go back, even now. But no; the old obduracy was on
him. Rosey had deceived him!</p>

<p>Then he seemed to have come again to <i>his</i> last minute. Once he was
fairly on the ship that was even now coaling for her voyage, once
the screw was on the move and the shore-lights vanishing, the die
would be cast. The stars that he and Rosey had seen in that cool
English garden that night he met her first would vanish, too, and a
world would be between them. Still, the hour had not come; it was
not too late yet. But still the inveterate thought came back&mdash;she
<i>had</i> deceived him.</p>

<p>So his delirium ended as its prototype of over twenty years ago had
ended. He hardened his heart, thrust aside all thought of
forgiveness and repentance, and went resolutely down to the quay, as
he thought, to embark on the little boat for the ship, and so
practically put all thought of hesitation and return out of his
mind. This moment was probably what would have been the crisis of
his fever, and it was an evil hour for him in which the builder of
the pier at St.&nbsp;Sennans made it so like the platform of that
experience of long ago. But the boat that he saw before him as he
stepped unhesitatingly over its edge was only the image of a
distempered brain, and in an instant he was struggling with the
cold, dark water. A sudden shock of chill, an intolerable choking
agony of breath involuntarily held, an instantaneous dissipation of
his dream, the natural result of the shock, and Fenwick knew himself
for what he was, and fought the cruel water in his despair. Even so
a drowning man fights who in old failures to learn swimming has just
mastered its barest rudiments. A vivid pageant rushed across his
mind of all the consequences of what seemed to him now his
inevitable death, clearest of all a sad vision of Sally and Rosalind
returning to their home alone&mdash;the black dresses and the silence. He
found voice for one long cry for help, without a hope that it could
be heard or that help could be at hand.</p>

<p>But he was neither unseen nor unheard, as you will know if we

<!-- Page 528 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
have
not failed in showing the succession of events. Sally never
hesitated an instant as she caught sight of the delirious man's
involuntary plunge into the green waves that had no terrors for
<i>her</i>. She threw off as she ran, fast, fast down the wooden
stairway, the only clothes she could get rid of&mdash;her hat and light
summer cloak&mdash;and went straight, with a well-calculated dive, to
follow him and catch him as he rose. If only she did not miss him!
Let her once pinion his arms from behind, and she would get him
ashore even if no help came. Why, there was no sea to speak of!</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>The man Jacob Tracy, the father of Benjamin, saw something to
quicken his speed as he walked along the pier to help in the
discovery of the life-belt. Why did the swimming young lady from
Lobjoit's want to be rid of her wrap-up at that rate as she turned
so sharp round to run down the ladder? He increased a brisk walk to
a run as the lad, who had followed the young lady down the steps,
came running up again; for there was hysterical terror in his
voice&mdash;he was a mere boy&mdash;as he shouted something that became, as
distance lessened, "In t' wa-ater! in t' wa-ater! in t' wa-ater! in
t' wa-ater!" And he was waving something in his hand&mdash;a lady's hat
surely; for with an instinct of swift presence of mind&mdash;a quality
that is the breath of life to all that go down to the sea in ships,
mariners or fisher-folk&mdash;he had seen that the headgear Sally threw
away would tell its tale quicker than any words he could rely on
finding.</p>

<p>"Roon smart, yoong Benjamin&mdash;roon for the bo'ats and call out
'oars'! Roon, boy&mdash;you've no time to lose!" And as the father dashes
down the steps he spoke of as "the ladder" the son runs for all he
is worth to carry the alarm to the shore. He shouts, "Oars, oars,
oars!" as he was told. But it is not needed, for his thought of
bringing up the hat has done his work already for him. The
coastguard, though the pier itself hid the two immersions from him,
is quick of apprehension and ready with his glass, and has seen the
boy's return from below; and at the same time heard, not his words,
but the terror in them, and by some mysterious agency has sent a
flying word along the beach that has brought a population out to
help.</p>

<p>A bad time of the tide to get a boat off sharp, and a long shelving

<!-- Page 529 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
run of sandy shingle before we reach the sea; for all the boats are
on the upper strand of the beach, above the last high-water mark,
and the flow of the tide is scarcely an hour old. There is a short
squat cobble, flat-bottomed and of intolerable weight, down near the
waters, and its owner makes for it. Another man drives him out
seawards, against the constant lift of breaking waves, large enough
to be troublesome, small enough to be numerous. They give no chance
to the second man to leap into the boat, so deep has he to go,
pushing on until the pads are out and the boat controlled; but he
has barely time to feel the underdraw of the recoiling wave when the
straight scour of a keel comes down along the sand and pebbles&mdash;the
Ellen Jane, St.&nbsp;Sennans&mdash;half-pushed, half-borne by a crew three
minutes have extemporised. You two in the bows, and you two astarn,
and the spontaneous natural leader&mdash;the man the emergency makes&mdash;at
the tiller-ropes, and Ellen Jane is off, well drenched at the
outset. An oar swings round high in the air, not to knock one of you
two astarn into the water, and then, "Give way!" and then the short,
quick rhythm of the stroke, and four men at their utmost stress,
each knowing life and death may hang upon the greatness of his
effort.</p>

<p>The cobble is soon outshot, but its owner will not give in. He bears
away from the course of the boat that has passed him, to seek their
common object where the tide-drift may have swept it, beyond some
light craft at their moorings which would have hidden it for a
while. He has the right of it this time, for as he passes, straining
at his sculls, under the stern of a pleasure-yacht at anchor, his
eye is caught by a black spot rising on a wave, and he makes for it.
Not too fast at the last, though, but cautiously, so as to grasp the
man with the life-belt and hold him firm till help shall come to get
him on board. He might easily have overshot him; but he has him now,
and the four-oar sights him as she swings round between the
last-moored boat and the pier; and comes apace, the quicker for the
tide.</p>

<p>"What is it ye say, master? What do ye make it out the gentleman
says, Peter?" For Fenwick, hauled on board the cobble with the help
of a man from the other boat, who returns to his oar, is alive and
conscious, but not much more. A brandy-flask comes from somewhere in
the steerage, where a mop and a tin

<!-- Page 530 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
pot and a boathook live, and
its effect is good. The half-drowned man becomes articulate enough
to justify the report. "It's his daughter he's asking
for&mdash;overboard, too!" and then the man who spoke first says: "You be
easy in your mind, master; we'll find her. Bear away a bit, and lie
to, Tom." Tom is the man in the cobble, and he does as he is bidden.
He ships his sculls and drifts, watching round on all sides for what
may be just afloat near the surface. The four-oar remains, and the
eyes of her crew are straining hard to catch a sight of anything
that is not mere lift and ripple of a wave.</p>

<p>Then more boats one after another, and more, and the gathering crowd
that lines the shore sees them scatter and lie to, some way apart,
to watch the greater space of water. All drift, because they know
that what they seek is drifting, too, and that if they move they
lose their only chance; for the thing they have to find is so small,
so small, and that great waste of pitiless sea is so large. It is
their only chance.</p>

<p>The crowd, always growing, moves along the beach as the flotilla of
drifting boats move slowly with the tide. They can hear the shouting
from boat to boat, but catch but little of the words. They follow
on, with little speech among themselves, and hope dying slowly out
of their hearts. Gradually towards the jetty, where the girl they
are seeking sat, only a few days since, beside the man whose heart
the memory of yesterday is still rejoicing; the only trouble of
whose unconscious soul is the thought that he and she must soon be
parted, however short the term of their separation may be. He will
know more soon.</p>

<p>Suddenly the shouting increases in the boats, and excited voices
break the silence on the shore. It won't do to hope too much, but
surely all the boats are thickening to one spot.... No, it's
nothing!... Yes, it <i>is</i>&mdash;it <i>is</i> something&mdash;one knows what&mdash;sighted
abaft the Ellen Jane, whose steersman catches it with a boathook as
the oars we on the beach saw suddenly drop back water&mdash;slowly,
cautiously&mdash;and only wait for him to drag the light weight athwart
the gunwale to row for the dear life towards the town. The scattered
crowd turns and comes back, trampling the shingle, to meet the boat
as she lands, and follow what she brings to the nearest haven.</p>

<p class="subhead">AN ERRAND IN VAIN, AND HOW DR. CONRAD CAME TO KNOW. CONCERNING
LLOYD'S COFFEEHOUSE, AND THE BATTLE OF CAMPERDOWN. MARSHALL HALL'S
SYSTEM AND SILVESTER'S. SOCIAL DISADVANTAGES. A CHAT WITH A
CENTENARIAN, AND HOW ROSALIND CAME TO KNOW. THOMAS LOCOCK OF
ROCHESTER. ONE&nbsp;O'CLOCK!</p>

<p>"Is that you, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad?" It was Rosalind who spoke, through the
half-open window of her bedroom, to the happy, expectant face of the
doctor in the little front garden below. "I'm only just up, and
they're both gone out. I shall be down in a few minutes." For she
had looked into her husband's room, and then into Sally's, and
concluded they must have gone out together. So much the better! If
Sally was with him, no harm could come to him.</p>

<p>"I don't see them anywhere about," said the doctor. Sally had not
been gone ten minutes, and at this moment had just caught sight of
Fenwick making for the pier. The short cut down took her out of
sight of the house. Rosalind considered a minute.</p>

<p>"Very likely they've gone to the hotel&mdash;the 'beastly hotel,' you
know." There is the sound of a laugh, and the caress in her voice,
as she thinks of Sally, whom she is quoting. "Gerry found a friend
there last night&mdash;a German gentleman&mdash;who was to go at seven-fifty.
Very likely he's walked up to say good-bye to him. Suppose you go to
meet them! How's Mrs.&nbsp;Vereker this morning?"</p>

<p>"Do you know, I haven't seen her yet! We talked rather late, so I
left without waking her. I've been for a walk."</p>

<p>"Well, go and meet Gerry. I feel pretty sure he's gone there." And
thereon Dr.&nbsp;Conrad departed, and so, departing towards the new town,
lost sight for the time being of the pier and the coast. He went by
the steps and Albion Villas, and as he caught a glimpse therefrom of
the pier-end in the distance, had an impression

<!-- Page 532 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
of a man running
along it and shouting; but he drew no inferences, although it struck
him there was panic, with the energy of sudden action, in this man's
voice.</p>

<p>He arrived at the hotel, of course without meeting either Sally or
Fenwick. He had accepted them as probably there, on perhaps too
slight evidence. But they might be in the hotel. Had the German
gentleman gone?&mdash;he asked. The stony woman he addressed replied from
her precinct, with no apparent consciousness that she was addressing
a fellow-creature, that No. 148, if you meant him, had paid and gone
by last 'bus. She spoke as to space, but as one too indifferent on
all points to care much who overheard her.</p>

<p>Vereker thanked her, and turned to go. As he departed he caught a
fragment of conversation between her and the waiter who had produced
the brandy the evening before. He was in undress uniform&mdash;a holland
or white-jean jacket, and a red woollen comforter. He had lost his
voice, or most of it, and croaked; and his cold had got worse in the
night. He was shedding tears copiously, and wiping them on a
cruet-stand he carried in one hand. The other was engaged by an
empty coal-scuttle with a pair of slippers in it, inexplicably.</p>

<p>"There's a start down there. Party over the pier-end! Dr.&nbsp;Maccoll
he's been 'phoned for."</p>

<p>"Party from this hotel?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't say. Porcibly. No partic'lars to identify, so far."</p>

<p>"They're not bringing him here?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't say, miss; but I should say they wasn't myself."</p>

<p>"If you know you can say. Who told you, and what did <i>he</i> say? Make
yourself understood."</p>

<p>"Dr.&nbsp;Maccoll he's been 'phoned for. You can inquire and see if I
ain't right. Beyond that I take no responsibility."</p>

<p>The Lady of the Bureau came out; moved, no doubt, by an image of a
drowned man whose resources would not meet the credits she might be
compelled to give him. She came out to the front through the
swing-door, looked up and down the road, and seemed to go back
happier. Dr.&nbsp;Conrad's curiosity was roused, and he started at once
for the beach, but absolutely without a trace of personal misgiving.
No doubt the tendency we all have to impute public mishaps to a
special class of people outside

<!-- Page 533 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
our own circle had something to do
with this. As he passed down an alley behind some cottages&mdash;a short
way to the pier&mdash;he was aware of a boy telling a tale in a terrified
voice to a man and an elderly woman. It was the man with the striped
shirt, and the boy was young Benjamin. He had passed on a few paces
when the man called to him, and came running after him, followed by
the woman and boy.</p>

<p>"I ask your pardon, sir&mdash;I ask your pardon...." What he has to say
will not allow him to speak, and his words will not come. He turns
for help to his companion. "<i>You</i> tell him, Martha woman," he says,
and gives in.</p>

<p>"My master thinks, sir, you may find something on the beach...."</p>

<p>"Something on the beach!..." Fear is coming into Dr.&nbsp;Conrad's face
and voice.</p>

<p>"Find something has happened on the beach. But they've got him
out...."</p>

<p>"Got him out! Got whom out? Speak up, for Heaven's sake!"</p>

<p>"It might be the gentleman you know, sir, and...." But the speaker's
husband, having left the telling to his wife, unfairly strikes in
here, to have the satisfaction of lightening the communication. "But
<i>he's</i> out safe, sir. You may rely on the yoong lad." He has made it
harder for his wife to tell the rest, and she hesitates. But Dr.
Conrad has stayed for no more. He is going at a run down the sloped
passage that leads to the sea. The boy follows him, and by some
dexterous use of private thoroughfares, known to him, but not to the
doctor, arrives first, and is soon visible ahead, running towards
the scattered groups that line the beach. The man and woman follow
more slowly.</p>

<p>Few of those who read this, we hope, have ever had to face a shock
so appalling as the one that Conrad Vereker sustained when he came
to know what it was that was being carried up the beach from the
boat that had just been driven stern on to the shingle, as he
emerged to a full view of the sea and the running crowd, thickening
as its last stragglers arrived to meet it. But most of us who are
not young have unhappily had some experience of the sort, and many
will recognise (if we can describe it) the feeling that was his in
excess when a chance bystander&mdash;not

<!-- Page 534 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
unconcerned, for no one was
that&mdash;used in his hearing a phrase that drove the story home to him,
and forced him to understand. "It's the swimming girl from
Lobjoit's, and she's drooned." It was as well, for he had to know.
What did it matter how he became the blank thing standing there,
able to say to itself, "Then Sally is dead," and to attach their
meaning to the words, but not to comprehend why he went on living?
One way of learning the thing that closes over our lives and veils
the sun for all time is as good as another; but how came he to be so
colourlessly calm about it?</p>

<p>If we could know how each man feels who hears in the felon's dock
the sentence of penal servitude for life, it may be we should find
that Vereker's sense of being for the moment a cold, unexplained
unit in an infinite unfeeling void, was no unusual experience. But
this unit knew mechanically what had happened perfectly well, and
its duty was clear before it. Just half a second for this sickness
to go off, and he would act.</p>

<p>It was a longer pause than it seemed to him, as all things appeared
to happen quickly in it, somewhat as in a photographic life-picture
when the films are run too quick. At least, that remained his memory
of it. And during that time he stood and wondered why he could not
feel. He thought of her mother and of Fenwick, and said to himself
they were to be pitied more than he; for they were human, and
<i>could</i> feel it&mdash;could really know what jewel they had lost&mdash;had
hearts to grieve and eyes to weep with. He had nothing&mdash;was a stupid
blank! Oh, he had been mistaken about himself and his love: he was a
stone.</p>

<p>A few moments later than his first sight of that silent
crowd&mdash;moments in which the world had changed and the sun had become
a curse; in which he had for some reason&mdash;not grief, for he could
not grieve&mdash;resolved on death, except in an event he dared not hope
for&mdash;he found himself speaking to the men who had borne up the beach
the thing whose germ of life, if it survived, was <i>his</i> only chance
of life hereafter.</p>

<p>"I am a doctor; let me come." The place they had brought it to was a
timber structure that was held as common property by the
fisher-world, and known as Lloyd's Coffeehouse. It was not a
coffeehouse, but a kind of spontaneous club-room, where the old men
sat and smoked churchwarden pipes, and told each other

<!-- Page 535 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
tales of
storm and wreck, and how the news of old sea-battles came to St.
Sennans in their boyhood; of wives made widows for their country's
good, and men all sound of limb when the first gun said "Death!"
across the water, crippled for all time when the last said
"Victory!" and there was silence and the smell of blood. Over the
mantel was an old print of the battle of Camperdown, with
three-deckers in the smoke, flanked by portraits of Rodney and
Nelson. There was a long table down the centre that had been there
since the days of Rodney, and on this was laid what an hour ago was
Sally; what each man present fears to uncover the face of, but less
on his own account than for the sake of the only man who seems
fearless, and lays hands on the cover to remove it; for all knew, or
guessed, what this dead woman might be&mdash;might have been&mdash;to this
man.</p>

<p>"I am a doctor; let me come."</p>

<p>"Are ye sure ye know, young master? Are ye sure, boy?" The speaker,
a very old man, interposes a trembling hand to save Vereker from
what he may not anticipate, perhaps has it in mind to beseech him to
give place to the local doctor, just arriving. But the answer is
merely, "I know." And the hand that uncovers the dead face never
wavers, and then that white thing we see is all there is of
Sally&mdash;that coil and tangle of black hair, all mixed with weed and
sea-foam, is the rich mass that was drying in the sun that day she
sat with Fenwick on the beach; those eyes that strain behind the
half-closed eyelids were the merry eyes that looked up from the
water at the boat she dived from two days since; those lips are the
lips the man who stands beside her kissed but yesterday for the
first time. The memory of that kiss is on him now as he wipes the
sea-slime from them and takes the first prompt steps for their
salvation.</p>

<p>The old Scotch doctor, who came in a moment later, wondered at the
resolute decision and energy Vereker was showing. He had been told
credibly of the circumstances of the case, and gave way on technical
points connected with resuscitation, surrendering views he would
otherwise have contended for about Marshall Hall's and Silvester's
respective systems. Perhaps one reason for this was that
auscultation of the heart convinced him that the case was hopeless,
and he may have reflected that if any other

<!-- Page 536 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
method than Dr.
Vereker's was used that gentleman was sure to believe the patient
might have been saved. Better leave him to himself.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Rosalind returned to her dressing, after Dr.&nbsp;Conrad walked away from
the house, with a feeling&mdash;not a logical one&mdash;that now she need not
hurry. Why having spoken with him and forwarded him on to look for
Sally and Gerry should make any difference was not at all clear, and
she did not account to herself for it. She accepted it as an
occurrence that put her somehow in touch with the events of the
day&mdash;made her a part of what was going on elsewhere. She had felt
lapsed, for the moment, when, waking suddenly to advanced daylight,
she had gone first to her husband's room and then to Sally's, and
found both empty. The few words spoken from her window with her
recently determined son-in-law had switched on her current again,
metaphorically speaking.</p>

<p>So she took matters easily, and was at rest about her husband, in
spite of the episode of the previous evening&mdash;rather, we should have
said, of the small hours of that morning. The fact is, it was her
first sleep she had waked from, an unusually long and sound one
after severe tension, and in the ordinary course of events she would
probably have gone to sleep again. Instead, she had got up at once,
and gone to her husband's room to relieve her mind about him. A
momentary anxiety at finding it empty disappeared when she found
Sally's empty also; but by that time she was effectually waked, and
rang for Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit and the hot water.</p>

<p>If Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit, when she appeared with it, had been able to give
particulars of Sally's departure, and to say that she and Mr.
Fenwick had gone out separately, Rosalind would have felt less at
ease about him; but nothing transpired to show that they had not
gone out together. Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit's data were all based on the fact
that she found the street door open when she went to do down her
step, and she had finished this job and gone back into the kitchen
by the time Sally followed Fenwick out. Of course, she never came
upstairs to see what rooms were empty; why should she? And as no
reason for inquiry presented itself, the question was never raised
by Rosalind. Sally was

<!-- Page 537 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
naturally an earlier bird than herself, and
quite as often as not she would join Gerry in his walk before
breakfast.</p>

<p>How thankful she felt, now that the revelation was over, that Sally
was within reach to help in calming down the mind that had been so
terribly shaken by it; for all her thoughts were of Gerry; on her
own behalf she felt nothing but contentment. Think what her daily
existence had been! What had she to lose by a complete removal of
the darkness that had shrouded her husband's early life with her&mdash;or
rather, what had she not to gain? Now that it had been assured to
her that nothing in the past could make a new rift between them, the
only weight upon her mind was the possible necessity for revealing
to Sally in the end the story of her parentage. What mother, to whom
a like story of her own early days was neither more nor less than a
glimpse into Hell, could have felt otherwise about communicating it
to her child? She felt, too, the old feeling of the difficulty there
would be in making Sally understand. The girl had not chanced across
devildom enough to make her an easy recipient of such a tale.</p>

<p>Oh, the pleasure with which she recalled his last words of the night
before: "She is <i>my</i> daughter now!" It was the final ratification of
the protest of her life against the "rights" that Law and Usage
grant to technical paternity; rights that can only be abrogated or
ignored by a child's actual parent&mdash;its mother&mdash;at the cost of
insult and contumely from a world that worships its own folly and
ignores its own gods. Sally was hers&mdash;her own&mdash;hard as the terms of
her possession had been, and she had assigned a moiety of her rights
in her to the man she loved. What was the fatherhood of blood alone
to set against the one her motherhood had a right to concede, and
had conceded, in response to the spontaneous growth of a father's
love? What claim had devilish cruelty and treachery to any share in
their result&mdash;a result that, after all, was the only compensation
possible to their victim?</p>

<p>We do not make this endeavour to describe Rosalind's frame of mind
with a view to either endorsing or disclaiming her opinions. We
merely record them as those of a woman whose life-story was an
uncommon one; but not without a certain sympathy for the new
definition of paternity their philosophy involves,

<!-- Page 538 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
backed by a
feeling that its truth is to some extent acknowledged in the
existing marriage-law of several countries. As a set-off against
this, no woman can have a child entirely her own except by incurring
what are called "social disadvantages." The hare that breaks covert
incurs social disadvantages. A happy turn of events had shielded
Rosalind from the hounds, or they had found better sport elsewhere.
And her child was her own.</p>

<p>But even as the thought was registered in her mind, that child lay
lifeless; and her husband, stunned and dumb in his despair, dared
not even long that she, too, should know, to share his burden.</p>

<p>"Those people are taking their time," said she. Not that she was
pressingly anxious for them to come home. It was early still, and
the more Gerry lived in the present the better. Sally and her lover
were far and away the best foreground for the panorama of his mind
just now, and she herself would be quite happy in the middle
distance. There would be time and enough hereafter, when the storm
had subsided, for a revelation of all those vanished chapters of his
life in Canada and elsewhere.</p>

<p>It was restful to her, after the tension and trial of the night, to
feel that he was happy with Sally and poor Prosy. What did it really
matter how long they dawdled? She could hear in anticipation their
voices and the laughter that would tell her of their coming. In a
very little while it would be a reality, and, after all, the
pleasure of a good symposium over Sally's betrothal was still to
come. She and Gerry and the two principals had not spoken of it
together yet. That would be a real happiness. How seldom it was that
an engagement to marry gave such complete satisfaction to
bystanders! And, after all, <i>they</i> are the ones to be consulted; not
the insignificant bride and bridegroom elect. Perhaps, though, she
was premature in this case. Was there not the Octopus? But then she
remembered with pleasure that Conrad had represented his mother as
phenomenally genial in her attitude towards the new arrangement; as
having, in fact, a claim to be considered not only a bestower of
benign consent, but an accomplice before the fact. Still, Rosalind
felt her own reserves on the subject, although she had always taken
the part of the Octopus on principle when she

<!-- Page 539 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
thought Sally had
become too disrespectful towards her. Anyhow, no use to beg and
borrow troubles! Let her dwell on the happiness only that was before
them all. She pictured a variety of homes for Sally in the time to
come, peopling them with beautiful grandchildren&mdash;only, mind you,
this was to be many, many years ahead! She could not cast herself
for the part of grandmother while she twined that glorious hair into
its place with hands that for softness and whiteness would have
borne comparison with Sally's own.</p>

<p>In the old days, before the news of evil travelled fast, the widowed
wife would live for days, weeks, months, unclouded by the knowledge
of her loneliness, rejoicing in the coming hour that was to bring
her wanderer back; and even as her heart laughed to think how now,
at last, the time was drawing near for his return, his heart had
ceased to beat, and, it may be, his bones were already bleaching
where the assassin's knife had left him in the desert; or were
swaying to and fro in perpetual monotonous response to the
ground-swell, in some strange green reflected light of a sea-cavern
no man's eye had ever seen; or buried nameless in a common tomb with
other victims of battle or of plague; or, worst of all, penned in
some dungeon, mad to think of home, waking from dreams of <i>her</i> to
the terror of the intolerable night, its choking heat or deadly
chill. And all those weeks or months the dearth of news would seem
just the chance of a lost letter, no more&mdash;a thing that may happen
any day to any of us. And she would live on in content and hope,
jesting even in anticipation of his return.</p>

<p>Even so Rosalind, happy and undisturbed, dwelt on the days that were
to come for the merpussy and poor Prosy, as she still had chosen to
call him, for her husband and herself; and all the while <i>there</i>, so
near her, was the end of it all, written in letters of death.</p>

<p>They were taking their time, certainly, those people; so she would
put her hat on and go to meet them. Mrs.&nbsp;Lobjoit wasn't to hurry
breakfast, but wait till they came. All right!</p>

<p>It looked as if it would rain later, so it was just as well to get
out a little now. Rosalind was glad of the sweet air off the sea,
for the night still hung about her. The tension of it was on her
still, for all that she counted herself so much the better, so much

<!-- Page 540 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
the safer, for that interview with Gerry. But oh, what a thing to
think that now he knew <i>her</i> as she had known him from the
beginning! How much they would have to tell each other, when once
they were well in calm water!... Why were those girls running, and
why did that young man on the beach below shout to some one who
followed him, "It's over at the pier"?</p>

<p>"Is anything the matter?" She asked the question of a very old man,
whom she knew well by sight, who was hurrying his best in the same
direction. But his best was but little, as speed, though it did
credit to his age; for old Simon was said to be in his hundredth
year. Rosalind walked easily beside him as he answered:</p>

<p>"I oondersta'and, missis, there's been a fall from the pier-head....
Oh yes, they've getten un out; ye may easy your mind o' that." But,
for all that, Rosalind wasn't sorry her party were up at the hotel.
She had believed them there long enough to have forgotten that she
had no reason for the belief to speak of.</p>

<p>"You've no idea who it is?"</p>

<p>"Some do say a lady and a gentleman." Rosalind felt still gladder of
her confidence that Sally and Gerry were out of the way. "'Ary one
of 'em would be bound to drown but for the boats smart and
handy&mdash;barring belike a swimmer like your young lady! She's a rare
one, to tell of!"</p>

<p>"I believe she is. She swam round the Cat Buoy in a worse sea than
this two days ago."</p>

<p>"And she would, too!" Then the old boy's voice changed as he went
on, garrulous: "But there be seas, missis, no man can swim in. My
fower boys, they were fine swimmers&mdash;all fower!"</p>

<p>"But were they?..." Rosalind did not like to say drowned; but old
Simon took it as spoken.</p>

<p>"All fower of 'em&mdash;fine lads all&mdash;put off to the wreck&mdash;wreck o' th'
brig Thyrsis, on th' Goodwins&mdash;and ne'er a one come back. And I had
the telling of it to their mother. And the youngest, he never was
found; and the others was stone dead ashore, nigh on to the
Foreland. There was none to help. Fifty-three year ago come this
Michaelmas."</p>

<p>"Is their mother still living?" Rosalind asked, interested. Old

<!-- Page 541 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
Simon had got to that stage in which the pain of the past is less
than the pleasure of talking it over. "Died, she did," said he,
almost as though he were unconcerned, "thirty-five year ago&mdash;five
year afower ever I married my old missis yander." Rosalind felt less
sympathy. If she were to lose Sally or Gerry, would she ever be able
to talk like this, even if she lived to be ninety-nine? Possibly
yes&mdash;only she could not know it now. She felt too curious about what
had happened at the pier to think of going back, and walked on with
old Simon, not answering him much. He seemed quite content to talk.</p>

<p>She did not trouble herself on the point of her party returning and
not finding her. Ten chances to one they would hear about the
accident, and guess where she had gone. Most likely they would
follow her. Besides, she meant to go back as soon as ever she knew
what had happened.</p>

<p>Certainly there were a great many people down there round about
Lloyd's Coffeehouse! Had a life been lost? How she hoped not! What a
sad end it would be to such a happy holiday as theirs had been! She
said something to this effect to the old man beside her. His reply
was: "Ye may doubt of it, in my judgment, missis. The rowboats were
not long enough agone for that. Mayhap he'll take a bit of nursing
round, though." But he quickened his pace, and Rosalind was sorry
that a sort of courtesy towards him stood in her way. She would have
liked to go much quicker.</p>

<p>She could not quite understand the scared look of a girl to whom she
said, "Is it a bad accident? Do you know who it is?" nor why this
girl muttered something under her breath, then got away, nor why so
many eyes, all tearful, should be fixed on <i>her</i>. She asked again of
the woman nearest her, "Do you know who it is?" but the woman
gasped, and became hysterical, making her afraid she had accosted
some anxious relative or near friend, who could not bear to speak of
it. And still all the eyes were fixed upon her. A shudder ran
through her. Could that be pity she saw in them&mdash;pity for <i>her</i>?</p>

<p>"For God's sake, tell me at once! Tell me what this is...."</p>

<p>Still silence! She could hear through it sobs here and there in the
crowd, and then two women pointed to where an elderly man who looked
like a doctor came from a doorway close by. She

<!-- Page 542 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
heard the
hysterical woman break down outright, and her removal by friends,
and then the strong Scotch accent of the doctor-like man making a
too transparent effort towards an encouraging tone.</p>

<p>"There's nae reason to anteecipate a fatal tairmination, so far. I
wouldna undertake myself to say the seestolic motion of the heart
was...." But he hesitated, with a puzzled look, as Rosalind caught
his arm and hung to it, crying out: "Why do you tell <i>me</i> this? For
God's sake, speak plain! I am stronger than you think."</p>

<p>His answer came slowly, in an abated voice, but clearly: "Because
they tauld me ye were the girl's mither."</p>

<p>In the short time that had passed since Rosalind's mind first
admitted an apprehension of evil the worst possibility it had
conceived was that Vereker or her husband was in danger. No
misgiving about Sally had entered it, except so far as a swift
thought followed the fear of mishap to one of them. "How shall Sally
be told of this? When and where will she know?"</p>

<p>Two of the women caught her as she fell, and carried her at the
Scotch doctor's bidding into a house adjoining, where Fenwick had
been carried in a half-insensible collapse that had followed his
landing from the cobble-boat in which he was sculled ashore.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>"Tell me what has happened. Where is Dr.&nbsp;Vereker?" Rosalind asks the
question of any of the fisher-folk round her as soon as returning
consciousness brings speech. They look at each other, and the woman
the cottage seems to belong to says interrogatively, "The young
doctor-gentleman?" and then answers the last question. He is looking
to the young lady in at the Coffeehouse. But no one says what has
happened. Rosalind looks beseechingly round.</p>

<p>"Will you not tell me now? Oh, tell me&mdash;tell me the whole!"</p>

<p>"It's such a little we know ourselves, ma'am. But my husband will be
here directly. It was he brought the gentleman ashore...."</p>

<p>"Where is the gentleman?" Rosalind has caught up the speaker with a
decisive rally. Her natural strength is returning, prompted by
something akin to desperation.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 543 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"We have him in here, ma'am. But he's bad, too! Here's my husband.
Have ye the brandy, Tom?"</p>

<p>Rosalind struggles to her feet from the little settee they had laid
her on. Her head is swimming, and she is sick, but she says: "Let me
come!" She has gathered this much&mdash;that whatever has happened to
Sally, Vereker is there beside her, and the other doctor she knows
of. She can do nothing, and Gerry is close at hand. They let her
come, and the woman and her husband follow. The one or two others go
quietly out; there were too many for the tiny house.</p>

<p>That is Gerry, she can see, on the trestle-bedstead near the window
with the flowerpots in it. He seems only half conscious, and his
hands and face are cold. She cannot be sure that he has recognised
her. Then she knows she is being spoken to. It is the fisherman's
wife who speaks.</p>

<p>"We could find no way to get the gentleman's wet garments from him,
but we might make a shift to try again. He's a bit hard to move. Not
too much at once, Tom." Her husband is pouring brandy from his flask
into a mug.</p>

<p>"Has he had any brandy?"</p>

<p>"Barely to speak of. Tell the lady, Tom!"</p>

<p>"No more than the leaving of a flask nigh empty out in my boat. It
did him good, too. He got the speech to tell of the young lady,
else&mdash;God help us!&mdash;we might have rowed him in, and lost the bit of
water she was under. But we had the luck to find her." It was the
owner of the cobble who spoke.</p>

<p>"Gerry, drink some of this at once. It's me&mdash;Rosey&mdash;your wife!" She
is afraid his head may fail, for anything may happen now; but the
brandy the fisherman's wife has handed to her revives him. No one
speaks for awhile, and Rosalind, in the dazed state that so
perversely notes and dwells on some small thing of no importance,
and cannot grasp the great issue of some crisis we are living
through, is keenly aware of the solemn ticking of a high grandfather
clock, and of the name of the maker on its face&mdash;"Thomas Locock,
Rochester." She sees it through the door into the front room, and
wonders what the certificate or testimonial in a frame beside it is;
and whether the Bible on the table below it, beside the fat blue jug
with a ship and inscriptions on it, has illustrations and the Stem
of Jesse rendered pictorially.

<!-- Page 544 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
Or is it "Pilgrim's Progress," and
no Bible at all? Who or what is she, that can sit and think of this
and that, knowing that a world&mdash;her world and her husband's&mdash;is at
stake, and that a terrible game is being played to save it, there
within twenty yards of them? If she could only have given active
help! But that she knows is impossible. She knows enough to be
satisfied that all that can be done is being done; that even warmth
and stimulants are useless, perhaps even injurious, till artificial
respiration has done its work. She can recall Sally's voice telling
her of these things. Yes, she is best here beside her husband.</p>

<p>What is it that he says in a gasping whisper? Can any one tell him
what it is has happened? She cannot&mdash;perhaps could not if she
knew&mdash;and she does not yet know herself. She repeats her question to
the fisherman and his wife. They look at each other and say young
Ben Tracy was on the pier. Call him in. It is something to know that
what has happened was on the pier. While young Ben is hunted up the
opportunity is taken to make the change of wet clothes for
extemporised dry ones. The half-drowned, all-chilled, and bewildered
man is reviving, and can help, though rigidly and with difficulty.
Then Ben is brought in, appalled and breathless.</p>

<p>The red-eyed and tear-stained boy is in bad trim for giving
evidence, but under exhortation to speak up and tell the lady he
articulates his story through his sobs. He is young, and can cry. He
goes back to the beginning.</p>

<p>His father told him to run and hunt round for the life-belt, and he
went to left instead of to right, and missed of seeing it. And he
was at the top o' the ladder, shooat'un aloud to his father, and the
gentleman&mdash;he nodded towards Fenwick&mdash;was walking down below. Then
the young lady came to the top stair of the ladder. The narrator
threw all his powers of description into the simultaneousness of
Sally's arrival at this point and the gentleman walking straight
over the pier-edge. "And then the young lady she threw away her hat,
and come runnin' down, runnin' down, and threw away her cloak, she
<i>did</i>, and stra'at she went for t' wa'ater!" Young Benjamin's story
and his control over his sobs come to an end at the same time, and
his father, just arrived, takes up the tale.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 545 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"I saw there was mishap in it," he says, "by the manner of my young
lad with the lady's hat, and I went direct for the life-belt, for
I'm no swimmer myself. Tom, man, tell the lady I'm no swimmer...."
Tom nodded assent, "... or I might have tried my luck. It was a bad
business that the life-belt was well away at the far end, and I had
no chance to handle it in time. It was the run of the tide took them
out beyond the length of the line, and I was bound to make the best
throw I could, and signal to shore for a boat." He was going to tell
how the only little boat at the pier-end had got water-logged in the
night, when Rosalind interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Did you see them both in the water?"</p>

<p>"Plain. The young lady swimming behind and keeping the gentleman's
head above the water. I could hear her laughing like, and talking.
Then I sent the belt out, nigh half-way, and she saw it and swam for
it. Then I followed my young lad for to get out a shore-boat."</p>

<p>It was the thought of the merpussy laughing like and talking in the
cruel sea that was to engulf her that brought a heart-broken choking
moan from her mother. Then, all being told, the fisher-folk glanced
at each other, and by common consent went noiselessly from the room
and lingered whispering outside. They closed the outer door, leaving
the cottage entirely to Rosalind and her husband, and then they two
were alone in the darkened world; and Conrad Vereker, whom they
could not help, was striving&mdash;striving against despair&mdash;to bring
back life to Sally.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>A terrible strain&mdash;an almost killing strain&mdash;had been put upon
Fenwick's powers of endurance. Probably the sudden shock of his
immersion, the abrupt suppression of an actual fever almost at the
cost of sanity, had quite as much to do with this as what he was at
first able to grasp of the extent of the disaster. But actual chill
and exposure had contributed their share to the state of
semi-collapse in which Rosalind found him. Had the rower of the
cobble turned in-shore at once, some of this might have been saved;
but that would have been one pair of eyes the fewer, and every boat
was wanted. Now that his powerful constitution had the chance to
reassert itself, his revival went quickly.

<!-- Page 546 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
He was awakening to a
world with a black grief in it; but Rosey was there, and had to be
lived for, and think of his debt to her! Think of the great wrong he
did her in that old time that he had only regained the knowledge of
yesterday! Her hand in his gave him strength to speak, and though
his voice was weak it would reach the head that rested on his bosom.</p>

<p>"I can tell you now, darling, what I remember. I went off feverish
in the night after you left me, and I suppose my brain gave way, in
a sense. I went out early to shake it off, and a sort of delusion
completely got the better of me. I fancied I was back at Bombay,
going on the boat for Australia, and I just stepped off the
pier-edge. Our darling must have been there. Oh, Sally, Sally!..."
He had to pause and wait.</p>

<p>"Hope is not all dead&mdash;not yet, not yet!" Rosalind's voice seemed to
plead against despair.</p>

<p>"I know, Rosey dearest&mdash;not yet. I heard her voice ... oh, her
voice!... call to me to be still, and she would save me. And then I
felt her dear hand ... first my arm, then my head, on each side."
Again his voice was choking, but he recovered. "Then, somehow, the
life-belt was round me&mdash;I can't tell how, but she made me hold it so
as to be safe. She was talking and laughing, but I could not hear
much. I know, however, that she said quite suddenly, 'I had better
swim back to the pier. Hold on tight, Jeremiah!'..." He faltered
again before ending. "I don't know why she went, but she said, 'I
must go,' and swam away."</p>

<p>That was all Fenwick could tell. The explanation came later. It was
that unhappy petticoat-tape! A swimmer's leg-stroke may be
encumbered in a calm sea, or when the only question is of keeping
afloat for awhile. But in moderately rough water, and in a struggle
against a running tide&mdash;which makes a certain speed imperative&mdash;the
conditions are altered. Sally may have judged wrongly in trying to
return to the pier, but remember&mdash;she could not in the first moments
know that the mishap had been seen, and help was near at hand. Least
of all could she estimate the difficulty of swimming in a loosened
encumbered skirt. In our judgment, she would have done better to
remain near the life-belt, even if she, too, had ultimately had to
depend on it. The additional risk for Fenwick would have been small.</p>

<div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
</div>

<p>After he had ended what he had to tell he remained quite still, and
scarcely spoke during the hour that followed. Twice or three times
during that hour Rosalind rose to go out and ask if there was any
change. But, turning to him with her hand on the door, and asking
"Shall I go?" she was always met with "What good will it do? Conrad
will tell us at once," and returned to her place beside him. After
all, what she heard might be the end of Hope. Better stave off
Despair to the last.</p>

<p>She watched the deliberate hands of the clock going cruelly on,
unfaltering, ready to register in cold blood the moment that should
say that Sally, as they knew her, was no more. Thomas Locock, of
Rochester, had taken care of that. Where would those hands be on
that clock-face when all attempt at resuscitation had to stop? And
why live after it?</p>

<p>She fancied she could hear, at intervals, Dr.&nbsp;Conrad's voice giving
instructions; and the voice of the Scotsman, less doubtfully, which
always sounded like that of a medical man, for some reason not
defined. As the clock-hand pointed to ten, she heard both quite
near&mdash;outside Lloyd's Coffeehouse, evidently. Then she knew why she
had so readily relinquished her purpose of getting at Dr.&nbsp;Conrad for
news. It was the dread of seeing anything of the necessary
manipulation of the body. Could she have helped, it would have been
different. No, if she must look upon her darling dead, let it be
later. But now there was that poor fellow-sufferer within reach, and
she could see him without fear. She went out quickly.</p>

<p>"Can you come away?"</p>

<p>"Quite safely for a minute. The others have done it before."</p>

<p>"Is there a chance?"</p>

<p>"There is a chance." Dr.&nbsp;Conrad's hand as she grasps it is so cold
that it makes her wonder at the warmth of her own. She is strangely
alive to little things. "Yes&mdash;there <i>is</i> a chance," he repeats, more
emphatically, as one who has been contradicted. But the old Scotch
doctor had only said cautiously, "It would be airly times to be
geevin' up hopes," in answer to a half-suggestion of reference to
him in the words just spoken. Rosalind keeps the cold hand that has
taken hers, and the crushing weight of her own misery almost gives
place to her utter pity for

<!-- Page 548 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
the ash-white face before her, and the
tale there is in it of a soul in torture.</p>

<p>"What is the longest time ... the longest time...?" she cannot frame
her question, but both doctors take its meaning at once, repeating
together or between them, "The longest insensibility after
immersion? Many hours."</p>

<p>"But how many?" Six, certainly, is Dr.&nbsp;Conrad's testimony. But the
Scotchman's conscience plagues him; he must needs be truthful. "Vara
likely you're right," he says. "I couldna have borne testimony
pairsonally to more than two. But vara sairtainly you're more likely
to be right than I." His conscience has a chilling effect.</p>

<p>Fenwick, a haggard spectacle, has staggered to the door of the
cottage. He wants to get the attention of some one in the crowd that
stands about in silence, never intrusively near. It is the father of
young Benjamin, who comes being summoned.</p>

<p>"That man you told me about...." Fenwick begins.</p>

<p>"Peter Burtenshaw?"</p>

<p>"Ah! How long was he insensible?"</p>

<p>"Eight hours&mdash;rather better! We got him aboard just before eight
bells of the second dog-watch, and it was eight bells of the middle
watch afore he spoke. Safe and sure! Wasn't I on the morning-watch
myself, and beside him four hours of the night before, and turned in
at eight bells? He'll tell you the same tale himself. Peter
Burtenshaw&mdash;he's a stevedore now, at the new docks at Southampton."
Much of this was quite unintelligible&mdash;ship's time is always a
problem&mdash;but it was reassuring, and Rosalind felt grateful to the
speaker, whether what he said was true or not. In that curious frame
of mind that observed the smallest things, she was just aware of the
difficulty in the way of a reference to Peter Burtenshaw at the new
docks at Southampton. Then she felt a qualm of added sickness at
heart as she all but thought, "How that will amuse Sally when I come
to tell it to her!"</p>

<p>The old Scotchman had to keep an appointment&mdash;connected with birth,
not death. "I've geen my pledge to the wench's husband," he said,
and went his way. Rosalind saw him stopped as he walked through the
groups that were lingering silently for a chance of good news; and
guessed that he had none to give, by the

<!-- Page 549 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
way his questioners fell
back disappointed. She was conscious that the world was beginning to
reel and swim about her; was half asking herself what could it all
mean&mdash;the waiting crowds of fisher-folk speaking in undertones among
themselves; the pitying eyes fixed on her and withdrawn as they met
her own; the fixed pallor and tense speech of the man who held her
hand, then left her to return again to an awful task that had,
surely, something to do with her Sally, there in that cramped
tarred-wood structure close down upon the beach. What did his words
mean: "I must go back; it is best for you to keep away"? Oh, yes;
now she knew, and it was all true. She saw how right he was, but she
read in his eyes the reason why he was so strong to face the terror
that she knew was <i>there</i>&mdash;in <i>there</i>! It was that he knew so well
that death would be open to him if defeat was to be the end of the
battle he was fighting. But there should be no panic. Not an inch of
ground should be uncontested.</p>

<p>Back again in the little cottage with Gerry, but some one had helped
her back. Surely, though, his voice had become his own again as he
said: "We are no use, Rosey darling. We are best here. Conrad knows
what he's about." And there was a rally of real hope, or a bold bid
for it, when his old self spoke in his words: "Why does that solemn
old fool of a Scotch doctor want to put such a bad face on the
matter? Patience, sweetheart, patience!"</p>

<p>For them there was nothing else. They could hinder, but they could
not help, outside there. Nothing for it now but to count the minutes
as they passed, to feel the cruelty of that inexorable clock in the
stillness; for the minutes passed too quickly. How could it be else,
when each one of them might have heralded a hope and did not; when
each bequeathed its little legacy of despair? But was there need
that each new clock-tick as it came should say, as the last had
said: "Another second has gone of the little hour that is left;
another inch of the space that parts us from the sentence that knows
no respite or reprieve"? Was it not enough that the end must come,
without the throb of that monotonous reminder: "Nearer
still!&mdash;nearer still!"</p>

<p>Neither spoke but a bare word or two, till the eleventh stroke of
the clock, at the hour, left it resonant and angry, and St.&nbsp;Sennans
tower answered from without. Then Rosalind said, "Shall

<!-- Page 550 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
I go out
and see, now?" and Fenwick replied, "Do, darling, if you wish to.
But he would tell us at once, if there were anything." She answered,
"Yes, perhaps it's no use," and fell back into silence.</p>

<p>She was conscious that the crowd outside had increased, in spite of
a fine rain that had followed the overclouding of the morning. She
could hear the voices of other than the fisher-folk&mdash;some she
recognised as those of beach acquaintance. That was Mrs.&nbsp;Arkwright,
the mother of Gwenny. And that was Gwenny herself, crying bitterly.
Rosalind knew quite well, though she could hear no words, that
Gwenny was being told that she could not go to Miss Nightingale now.
She half thought she would like to have Gwenny in, to cry on her and
make her perhaps feel less like a granite-block in pain. But, then,
was not Sally a baby of three once? She could remember the pleasure
the dear old Major had at seeing baby in her bath, and how he
squeezed a sponge over her head, and she screwed her eyes up. He had
died in good time, and escaped this inheritance of sorrow. How could
she have told him of it?</p>

<p>What was she that had outlived him to bear all this? Much, so much,
of her was two dry, burning eyes, each in a ring of pain, that had
forgotten tears and what they meant. How was it that now, when that
Arkwright woman's voice brought back her talk upon the beach, not
four-and-twenty hours since, and her unwelcome stirring of the dead
embers of a burned-out past&mdash;how was it that that past, at its
worst, seemed easier to bear than this intolerable <i>now</i>? How had it
come about that a memory of twenty years ago, a memory of how she
had prayed that her unborn baby might die, rather than live to
remind her of that black stain upon the daylight, its father, had
become in the end worse to her, in her heart of hearts, than the
thing that caused it? And then she fell to wondering when it was
that her child first took hold upon her life; first crept into it,
then slowly filled it up. She went back on little incidents of that
early time, asking herself, was it then, or then, I first saw that
she was Sally? She could recall, without adding another pang to her
dull, insensate suffering, the moment when the baby, as the Major
and General Pellew sat playing chess upon the deck, captured the
white king, and sent him flying into the Mediterranean;

<!-- Page 551 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
and though
she could not smile now, could know how she would have smiled
another time. Was that white king afloat upon the water still? A
score of little memories of a like sort chased one another as her
mind ran on, all through the childhood and girlhood of their
subject. And now&mdash;it was all to end....</p>

<p>And throughout those years this silent man beside her, this man she
meant to live for still, for all it should be in a darkened
world&mdash;this man was ... where? To think of it&mdash;in all those years,
no Sally for him! See what she had become to him in so short a
time&mdash;such a little hour of life! Think of the waste of it&mdash;of what
she might have been! And it was she, the little unconscious thing
herself, that sprang from what had parted them. If she had to face
all the horrors of her life anew for it, would she flinch from one
of them, only to hear that the heart that had stopped its beating
would beat again, that the voice that was still would sound in her
ears once more?</p>

<p>Another hour! The clock gave out its warning that it meant to
strike, in deadly earnest with its long premonitory roll. Then all
those twelve strokes so quick upon the heels of those that sounded
but now, as it seemed. Another hour from the tale of those still
left but reasonable hope; another hour nearer to despair. The
reverberations died away, and left the cold insensate tick to
measure out the next one, while St.&nbsp;Sennans tower gave its answer as
before.</p>

<p>"Shall I go now, Gerry, to see?"</p>

<p>"I say not, darling; but go, if you like." He could not bear to hear
it, if it was to be the death-sentence. So Rosalind still sat on to
the ticking of the clock.</p>

<p>Her brain and powers of thought were getting numbed. Trivial things
came out of the bygone times, and drew her into dreams&mdash;back into
the past again&mdash;to give a moment's spurious peace; then forsook her
treacherously to an awakening, each time deadlier than the last.
Each time to ask anew, what could it all mean? Sally dead or
dying&mdash;Sally dead or dying! Each time she repeated the awful words
to herself, to try to get a hold she was not sure she had upon their
meaning. Each time she slipped again into a new dream and lost it.</p>

<p>Back again now, in the old days of her girlhood! Back in that

<!-- Page 552 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
little front garden of her mother's house, twenty odd years ago, and
Gerry's hand in hers&mdash;the hand she held to now; and Gerry's face
that now, beside her, looked so still and white and heart-broken,
all aglow with life and thoughtless youth and hope. Again she felt
upon her lips his farewell kiss, not to be renewed until ... but at
the thought she shuddered away, horror-stricken, from the nightmare
that any memory must be of what then crossed her life, and robbed
them both of happiness. And then her powers of reason simply reeled
and swam, and her brain throbbed as she caught the thought forming
in it: "Better happiness so lost, and all the misery over again,
than this blow that has come upon us now! Sally dead or dying&mdash;Sally
dead or dying!" For what was <i>she</i>, the thing we could not bear to
lose, but the living record, the very outcome, of the poisoned soil
in that field of her life her memory shrank from treading?</p>

<p>What was that old Scotchman&mdash;he seemed to have come back&mdash;what was
he saying outside there? Yes, listen! Fenwick starts up, all his
life roused into his face. If only that clock would end that long
unnecessary roll of warning, and strike! But before the
long-deferred single stroke comes to say another hour has passed, he
is up and at the door, with Rosalind clinging to him terrified.</p>

<p>"What's the news, doctor? Tell it out, man!&mdash;never fear." Rosalind
dares not ask; her heart gives a great bound, and stops, and her
teeth chatter and close tight. She could not speak if she tried.</p>

<p>"I wouldna like to be over-confeedent, Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick, and ye'll
understand I'm only geevin' ye my own eempression...."</p>

<p>"Yes, quite right&mdash;go on...."</p>

<p>"Vara parteecularly because our young friend Dr.&nbsp;Vereker is
unwulling to commeet himself ... but I should say a
pairceptible...."</p>

<p>He is interrupted. For with a loud shout Dr.&nbsp;Conrad himself,
dishevelled and ashy-white of face, comes running from the door
opposite. The word he has shouted so loudly he repeats twice; then
turns as though to go back. But he does not reach the door, for he
staggers suddenly, like a man struck by a bullet, and falls heavily,
insensible.</p>

<p>There is a movement and a shouting among the scattered groups that
have been waiting, three hours past, as those nearest at hand run to
help and raise him; and the sound of voices and exultation passes
from group to group. For what he shouted was the one word "Breath!"
And Rosalind knew its meaning as her head swam and she heard no
more.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVII" id="CHAPTER_XLVII"></a>CHAPTER XLVII</h2>

<p class="subhead">WAS IT THE LITTLE GALVANIC BATTERY? THE LAST CHAPTER RETOLD BY THE
PRESS. A PROPER RAILING. BUT THEY <i>WEREN'T</i> DROWNED. WHAT'S THE
FUSS? MASTER CHANCELLORSHIP APPEARS AND VANISHES. ELECTUARY OF
ST.&nbsp;SENNA. AT GEORGIANA TERRACE. A LETTER FROM SALLY. ANOTHER FROM
CONRAD. EVERYTHING VANISHES!</p>

<p>Professor Sales Wilson, Mrs.&nbsp;Julius Bradshaw's papa, was enjoying
himself thoroughly. He was the sole occupant of 260, Ladbroke Grove
Road, servants apart. All his blood-connected household had departed
two days after the musical evening described in <a href="#CHAPTER_XL">Chapter XL.</a>,
and there was nothing that pleased him better than to have London to
himself&mdash;that is to say, to himself and five millions of perfect
strangers. He had it now, and could wallow unmolested in Sabellian
researches, and tear the flimsy theories of Bopsius&mdash;whose name we
haven't got quite right&mdash;to tatters. Indeed, we are not really sure
the researches <i>were</i> Sabellian. But no matter!</p>

<p>Just at the moment at which we find him, the Professor was not
engaged in any researches at all, unless running one's eye down the
columns of a leading journal, to make sure there is nothing in them,
is a research. That is what he was doing in his library. And he was
also talking to himself&mdash;a person from whom he had no reserves or
concealments. What he had to say ran in this wise:</p>

<p>"H'm!&mdash;h'm!&mdash;'The Cyclopean Cyclop&aelig;dia.' Forty volumes in calf. Net
price thirty-five pounds. A digest of human knowledge, past,
present, and probable. With a brief appendix enumerating the things
of which we are still ignorant, and of our future ignorance of which
we are scientifically certain ... h'm! h'm!... not dear at the
price. But stop a bit! 'Until twelve o'clock on Saturday next copies
of the above, with revolving

<!-- Page 555 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
bookcase, can be secured for the low
price of seven pounds ten.'..." This did not seem to increase the
speaker's confidence and he continued, as he wrestled with a
rearrangement of the sheet: "Shiny paper, and every volume weighs a
ton. Very full of matter&mdash;everything in it except the thing you want
to know. By-the-bye ... what a singular thing it is, when you come
to think of it, that so many people will sell you a thing worth a
pound for sixpence, who won't give you a shilling outright on any
terms! It must have to do with their unwillingness to encourage
mendicancy. A noble self-denial, prompted by charity organizations!
Hullo!&mdash;what's this? 'Heroic rescue from drowning at St.
Sennans-on-Sea.' H'm&mdash;h'm&mdash;h'm!&mdash;can't read all that. But <i>that's</i>
where the married couple went&mdash;St.&nbsp;Sennans-on-Sea. The bride
announced her intention yesterday of looking in at five to-day for
tea. So I suppose I shall be disturbed shortly."</p>

<p>The soliloquist thought it necessary to repeat his last words twice
to convince himself and the atmosphere that his position was one of
grievance. Having done this, and feeling he ought to substantiate
his suggestion that he was just on the point of putting salt on the
tail of an unidentified Samnite, or a finishing touch on the
demolition of Bopsius, he folded his newspaper, which we suspect he
had not been reading candidly from, and resumed his writing.</p>

<p>Did you ever have a quarter of an hour of absolutely unalloyed
happiness? Probably not, if you have never known the joys of
profound antiquarian erudition, with an unelucidated past behind
you, and inexpensive publication before. The Professor's fifteen
minutes that followed were not only without alloy, but had this
additional zest&mdash;that that girl would come bothering in directly,
and he would get his grievance, and work it. And at no serious
expense, for he was really very partial to his daughter, and meant,
<i>au fond de soi</i>, to enjoy her visit. Nevertheless, discipline had
to be maintained, if only for purposes of self-deception, and the
Professor really believed in his own "Humph! I supposed it would be
that," when L&aelig;titia's knock came at the street door.</p>

<p>"Such a shame to disturb you, papa dear! But you'll have to give me
tea&mdash;you said you would."</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 556 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"It isn't five o'clock yet. Well&mdash;never mind. Sit down and don't
fidget. I shall have done presently.... No! make yourself useful now
you <i>are</i> here. Get me 'Passeri Pictur&aelig; Etruscorum,' volume three,
out of shelf C near the window ... that's right. Very good find for
a young married woman. Now sit down and read the paper&mdash;there's
something will interest you. You may ring for tea, only don't talk."</p>

<p>The Professor then became demonstratively absorbed in the
Sabellians, or Bopsius, or both, and L&aelig;titia acted as instructed,
but without coming on the newspaper-paragraph. She couldn't ask for
a clue after so broad a hint, so she had to be contented with
supposing her father referred to the return of Sir Charles
Penderfield, Bart., as a Home Rule Unionist and Protectionist Free
Trader. Only if it was that, it was the first she had ever known of
her father being aware of the Bart.'s admiration for herself. So she
made the tea, and waited till the pen-scratching stopped, and the
Sabellians or Bopsius were blotted, glanced through, and ratified.</p>

<p>"There, that'll do for that, I suppose." His tone surrendered the
grievance as an act of liberality, but maintained the principle.
"Well, have we found it?"</p>

<p>"Found what?"</p>

<p>"The heroic rescue&mdash;at your place&mdash;Saint Somebody&mdash;Saint
Senanus...."</p>

<p>"No! Do show me that." L&aelig;titia forms a mental image of a lifeboat
going out to a wreck. How excited Sally must have been!</p>

<p>"Here, give it me and I'll find it.... Yes&mdash;that's right&mdash;a big lump
and a little lump. I'm to take less sugar because of gout. Very
good! Oh ... yes ... here we are. 'Heroic Rescue at St.&nbsp;Sennans' ...
just under 'Startling Elopement at Clapham Rise'.... Got it?"</p>

<p>L&aelig;titia supplied the cup of tea, poured one for herself, and took
the paper from her father without the slightest suspicion of what
was coming. "It will have to wait a minute till I've had some tea,"
she said. "I'm as thirsty as I can be. I've been to see my
mother-in-law and Constance"&mdash;this was Julius's sister&mdash;"off to
Southend. And just fancy, papa; Pag and I played from nine till a
quarter-to-one last night, and he never felt

<!-- Page 557 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
it, nor had any
headache nor anything." The topic is so interesting that the unread
paragraph has to wait.</p>

<p>The Professor cannot think of any form of perversion better than
"Very discreditable to him. I hope you blew him well up?"</p>

<p>"Now, papa, don't be nonsensical! Do you know, I'm really beginning
to believe Pag's right, and it <i>was</i> the little galvanic battery.
Shouldn't you say so, though, seriously?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. If there wasn't a big galvanic battery, it must have been
the little one. It stands to reason. But <i>what</i> does my musical
son-in-law think was the little galvanic battery?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, papa, how ridiculous you are! Why, of course, his nerves
going away&mdash;as they really <i>have</i> done, you know; and I can't see
any good pretending they haven't. Yesterday was the fourth evening
he hasn't felt them...."</p>

<p>"Stop a bit! There is a lack of scientific precision in the
structure of your sentences. A young married woman ought really to
be more accurate. Now let's look it over, and do a little
considering. I gather, in the first place, that my son-in-law's
nerves going away was, or were, a little galvanic battery...."</p>

<p>"Dear papa, don't paradox and catch me out. Just this once, be
reasonable! Think what a glorious thing it would be for us if his
nerves <i>had</i> gone for good. Another cup? Was the last one right?"</p>

<p>"My position is peculiar. (Yes, the tea was all right.) I find
myself requested to be reasonable, and to embark on a career of
reasonableness by considering the substantial advantages to my
daughter and her husband of the disappearance of his nervous
system...."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish you wouldn't! <i>Do</i> be serious...." The Professor looked
at her reflectively as he drank the cup of tea, and it seemed to
dawn on him slowly that his daughter <i>was</i> serious. The fact is,
Tishy was very serious indeed, and was longing for sympathy over a
matter for great elation. She and Julius had been purposely playing
continuously for long hours to test the apparent suspension or
cessation of his nervous affection, and had not so far seen a sign
of a return; but they were dreadfully afraid of counting their
chickens in advance.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 558 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"I noticed the other evening"&mdash;the Professor has surrendered, and
become serious&mdash;"that Julius wasn't any the worse, and he had played
a long time. What should you do?" Tishy looked inquiringly. "Well, I
mean what steps could be taken if it were...?"</p>

<p>"If we could trust to it? Oh, no difficulty at all! Any number of
engagements directly."</p>

<p>"It would please your mother." Tishy cannot help a passing thought
on the oddity of her parents' relations to one another. Even though
he spoke of the Dragon as a connexion of his daughter he was but
little concerned with, the first thought that crossed his mind was a
sort of satisfaction under protest that she would have something to
be pleased about. Tishy wondered whether she and Julius would end up
like that. Of course they wouldn't! What pity people's parents were
so unreasonable!</p>

<p>"Yes; mamma wouldn't be at all sorry. Fiddlers are not Baronets, but
anything is better than haberdashing. <i>I'm</i> not ashamed of it, you
know." She had subjected herself gratuitously to her own suspicion
that she might be, and resented it.</p>

<p>Her father looked at her with an amused face; looked down at these
social fads of poor humanity from the height of his Olympus. If he
knew anything about the Unionist Home Ruler's aspirations for
L&aelig;titia, he said nothing. Then he asked a natural question&mdash;what
<i>was</i> the little galvanic battery? Tishy gave her account of it, but
before she had done the Professor was thinking about Sabines or
Lucanians. The fact is that Tishy was never at her best with her
father. She was always so anxious to please him that she tumbled
over her own anxiety, and in this present case didn't tell her story
as well as she might have done. He began considering how he could
get back to the shreds of Bopsius, if any were left, and looked at
his watch.</p>

<p>"Well, that was very funny&mdash;very funny!" said he absently. "Now,
don't forget the heroic rescue before you go."</p>

<p>Tishy perceived the delicate hint, and picked up the paper with "I
declare I was forgetting all about it!" But she had scarcely cast
her eyes on it when she gave a cry. "Oh, papa, papa; it's <i>Sally</i>!
Oh dear!" And then: "Oh dear, oh dear! I can hardly see to make it
out. But I'm sure she's all right! They say so." And kept on trying
to read. Her father did what

<!-- Page 559 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
was, under the circumstances, the best
thing to do&mdash;took the paper from her, and as she sank back with a
beating heart and flushed face on the chair she had just risen from
read the paragraph to her as follows:</p>

<div class="blockcenter">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Heroic Rescue from Drowning at St.&nbsp;Sennans-on-Sea.</span>&mdash;Early
this morning, as Mr.&nbsp;Algernon Fenwick, of Shepherd's Bush, at present on
a visit at the old town, was walking on the pier-end, at the point
where there is no rail or rope for the security of the public, his
foot slipped, and he was precipitated into the sea, a height of at
least ten feet. Not being a swimmer, his life was for some minutes
in the greatest danger; but fortunately for him his stepdaughter,
Miss Rosalind Nightingale, whose daring and brilliant feats in
swimming have been for some weeks past the admiration and envy of
all the visitors to the bathing quarter of this most attractive of
south-coast watering-places, was close at hand, and without a
moment's hesitation plunged in to his rescue. Encumbered as she was
by clothing, she was nevertheless able to keep Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick above
water, and ultimately to reach a life-buoy that was thrown from the
pier. Unfortunately, having established Mr.&nbsp;Fenwick in a position of
safety, she thought her best course would be to return to the pier.
She was unable in the end to reach it, and her strength giving way,
she was picked up, after an immersion of more than twenty minutes,
by the boats that put off from the shore. It will readily be
imagined that a scene of great excitement ensued, and that a period
of most painful anxiety followed, for it was not till nearly four
hours afterwards that, thanks to the skill and assiduity of Dr.
Fergus Maccoll, of <span class="smcap">22a</span>, Albion Crescent, assisted by Dr.&nbsp;Vereker, of
London, the young lady showed signs of life. We are happy to say
that the latest bulletins appear to point to a speedy and complete
recovery, with no worse consequences than a bad fright. We
understand that the expediency of placing a proper railing at all
dangerous points on the pier is being made the subject of a
numerously signed petition to the Town Council."</p>
</div>

<p>"That seems all right," said the Professor. And he said nothing
further, but remained rubbing his shaved surface in a sort of
compromising way&mdash;a way that invited or permitted exception to be
taken to his remark.</p>

<div>
<!-- Page 560 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
</div>

<p>"All right? Yes, but&mdash;oh, papa, do think what might have happened!
They might both have been drowned."</p>

<p>"But they weren't!"</p>

<p>"Of course they weren't! But they <i>might</i> have been."</p>

<p>"Well, it would have proved that people are best away from the
seaside. Not that any further proof is necessary. Now, good-bye, my
dear; I must get back to my work."</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>That afternoon Julius Bradshaw went on a business mission to
Cornhill, and was detained in the city till past five o'clock. It
was then too late to return to the office, as six was the closing
hour; so he decided on the Twopenny Tube to Lancaster Gate, the
nearest point to home. There was a great shouting of evening papers
round the opening into the bowels of the earth at the corner of the
Bank, and Julius's attention was caught by an unearthly boy with a
strange accent.</p>

<p>"'Mail and Echo,' third edition, all the latest news for a 'apeny.
Fullest partic'lars in my copies. Alderman froze to death on the
Halps. Shocking neglect of twins. 'Oxton man biles his third wife
alive. Cricket this day&mdash;Surrey going strong. More about heroic
rescue from drowning at St.&nbsp;Senna's. Full and ack'rate partic'lars
in my copies only. Catch hold!..." Julius caught hold, and thought
the boy amusing. Conversation followed, during cash settlements.</p>

<p>"Who's been heroically rescued?"</p>

<p>"Friend of mine&mdash;young lady&mdash;fished her governor out&mdash;got drownded
over it herself, and was brought to. 'Mail' a 'apeny; torkin' a
penny extra! Another 'apeny." Julius acquiesced, but felt entitled
to more talking.</p>

<p>"Where was it?"</p>

<p>"St.&nbsp;Senna's, where they make the lectury&mdash;black stuff.... Yes, it
<i>was</i> a friend o' mine, mister, so I tell you, and no lies! Miss
Rosalind Nightingale. I see her in the fog round Piccadilly way....
No, no lies at all! Told me her name of her own accord, and went
indoors." Julius would have tried to get to the bottom of this if he
had not been so taken aback by it, even at the cost of more pence
for conversation; but by the time he had found that his informant
had certainly read the paragraph, or at least mastered Sally's name
right, the boy had vanished.

<!-- Page 561 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
Of course, he was the boy with the gap
in his teeth that she had seen in the fog when Colonel Lund was
dying. We can only hope that his shrewdness and prudence in worldly
matters have since brought him the success they deserve, as his
disappearance was final.</p>

<p>Even the Twopenny Tube was too slow for Julius Bradshaw, so mad was
he with impatience to get to Georgiana Terrace. When he got there,
and went upstairs two steps at a time, and "I say, Tishy dearest,
look at <i>this</i>!" on his lips, he was met half-way by his young wife,
also extending a newspaper, and "Paggy, just <i>fancy</i> what's
happened! Look at <i>this</i>!"</p>

<p>They were so wild with excitement that they refused food&mdash;at least,
when it took the form of second helpings&mdash;and when the banquet was
over L&aelig;titia could do nothing but walk continually about the room
with gleaming eyes and a flushed face waiting furiously for the
post; for she was sure it would bring her a letter from Sally or her
mother. And she was right, for the rush to the street door that
followed the postman's knock resulted firstly in denunciations of an
intransitive letter-box nobody but a fool would ever have tried to
stuff all those into, and secondly in a pounce by L&aelig;titia on Sally's
own handwriting.</p>

<p>"You may just as well read it upstairs comfortably, Tish," says
Julius, meanly affecting stoicism now that it is perfectly
clear&mdash;for the arrival of the letter practically shows it&mdash;that
nobody is incapacitated by the accident. "Come along up!"</p>

<p>"All right!" says his wife. "Why, mine's written in pencil! Who's
yours from?"</p>

<p>"I haven't opened it yet. Come along. Don't be a goose!" This was a
little cheap stoicism, worth deferring satisfaction of curiosity
three minutes for.</p>

<p>"Whose handwriting is it?" She goes on devouring, intensely
absorbed, though she speaks.</p>

<p>"It looks like the doctor's."</p>

<p>"Of course! You'll see directly.... All right, I'm coming!"</p>

<p>Take your last look at the Julius Bradshaws, as they settle down
with animated faces to serious perusal of their letters. They may
just as well drink their coffee, though, and Julius will presently
light his cigar for anything we know to the contrary; but we shall
not see it, for when we have transcribed the two letters

<!-- Page 562 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
they are
reading we shall lay down our pen, and then, if you want to know any
more about the people in this story, you must inquire of the
originals, all of whom are still living except Dr.&nbsp;Vereker's mother,
who died last year, we believe. Here are the letters:</p>

<div class="corresp">
<p>"<span class="smcap">My dearest Tishy</span>,</p>

<p>"I have a piece of news to tell that will be a great surprise to
you. I am engaged to Conrad Vereker. Perhaps, though, I oughtn't to
say as much as that, because it hasn't gone any farther at present
than me promising not to marry any one else, and as far as I can see
I might have promised any man that.</p>

<p>"Now, don't write and say you expected it all along, because I
shan't believe you.</p>

<p>"Of course, tell anybody you like&mdash;only I hope they'll all say
that's no concern of theirs. I should be so much obliged to them.
Besides, so very little has transpired to go by that I can't see
exactly what they could either congratulate or twit about. Being
engaged is so very shadowy. Do you remember our dancing-mistress at
school, who had been engaged seven years to a dancing-master, and
then they broke it off by mutual consent, and she married a Creole?
And they'd saved up enough for a school of their own all the time!
However, as long as it's distinctly understood there's to be no
marrying at present, I don't think the arrangement a bad one. Of
course, you'll understand I mean other girls, and the sort of men
they get engaged to. With Prosy it's different; one knows where one
is. Only I shouldn't consider it honourable to jilt Prosy, even for
the sake of remaining single. You see what I mean.</p>

<p>"The reason of pencil (don't be alarmed!) is that I am writing this
in bed, having been too long in the water. It's to please Prosy,
because my System has had a shake. I <i>am</i> feeling very queer still,
and can't control my thumb to write. I must tell you about it, or
you'll get the story somewhere else and be frightened.</p>

<p>"It was all Jeremiah's fault, and I really can't think what he was
doing. He admits that he was seedy, and had had a bad night. Anyhow,
it was like this: I followed him down to the pier very early before
breakfast, and you remember where the man

<!-- Page 563 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
was fishing and caught
nothing that day? Well, what does Jeremiah do but just walk plump
over the edge. I had all but got to him, by good luck, and of course
I went straight for him and caught him before he sank. I induced him
not to kick and flounder, and got him inside a life-belt they threw
from the pier, and then I settled to leave him alone and swim to the
steps, because you've no idea how I felt my clothes, and it would
have been all right, only a horrible heavy petticoat got loose and
demoralised me. I don't know how it happened, but I got all wrong
somehow, and a breaker caught me. <i>Don't get drowned</i>, Tishy; or, if
you do, <i>don't be revived again</i>! I don't know which is worst, but I
think reviving. I can't write about it. I'll tell you when I come
back.</p>

<p>"They won't tell me how long I was coming to, but it must have been
much longer than I thought, when one comes to think of it. Only I
can't tell, because when poor dear Prosy had got me
to<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>&mdash;down
at Lloyd's Coffeehouse, where old Simon sits all day&mdash;and I had been
wrapped up in what I heard a Scotchman call 'weel-warmed blawnkets,'
and brought home in a closed fly from Padlock's livery stables, I
went off sound asleep with my fingers and toes tingling, and never
knew the time nor anything. (Continuation bit.) This is being
written, to tell you the truth, in the small hours of the morning,
in secrecy with a guttering candle. It seems to have been really
quite a terrible alarm to poor darling mother and Jeremiah, and much
about the same to my medical adviser, who resuscitated me on
Marshall Hall's system, followed by Silvester's, and finally opened
a vein. And there was I alive all the time, and not grateful to
Prosy at all, I can tell you, for bringing me to. I have requested
not to be brought to next time. The oddity of it all was
indescribable. And there, now I come to think of it, I've never so
much as seen the Octopus since Prosy and I got engaged. I shall have
to go round as soon as I'm up. (Later continuation bit&mdash;after
breakfast.) Do you know, it makes me quite miserable to think what
an anxiety I've been to all of them! Mother and J. can't take their
eyes off me, and look quite wasted and resigned. And poor dear
Prosy! How ever shall I make it up to him? Do you know,

<!-- Page 564 -->

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
as soon as
it was known I was to,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> the dear fellow actually tumbled down
insensible! I had no idea of the turn-out there's been until just
now, when mother and Jeremiah confessed up. Just fancy it! Now I
must shut up to catch the post.</p>

press-paragraph, for these things get about&mdash;that I think it best to
send you a line to say that, though we have all had a terrible time
of anxiety, no further disastrous consequences need be anticipated.
Briefly, the affair may be stated thus:</p>

<p>"Fenwick and Miss Nightingale were on the pier early this morning,
and from some unexplained false step F. fell from the lower stage
into the water. Miss N. immediately plunged in to his rescue, and
brought him in safety to a life-buoy that was thrown from the pier.
It seemed that she then started to swim back, being satisfied of his
safety till other help came, but got entangled with her clothes and
went under. She was brought ashore insensible, and remained so
nearly four hours. For a long time I was almost without hope, but we
persevered against every discouragement, with complete final
success. I am a good deal more afraid now of the effect of the shock
on Mrs.&nbsp;Fenwick and her husband than for anything that may happen to
Miss N., whose buoyancy of constitution is most remarkable. You will
guess that I had rather a rough time (the news came rather suddenly
to me), and all the more (but I know you will be glad to hear this)
that Miss N. and your humble servant had only just entered on an
engagement to be married at some date hereafter not specified. I am
ashamed to say I showed weakness (but not till I was sure the lungs
were acting naturally), and had to be revived with stimulants! I am
all right now, and, do you know, I really believe my mother will be
all the better for it; for when she heard what had happened, she
actually got up and <i>ran</i>&mdash;yes, ran&mdash;to Lloyd's Coffeehouse (you
remember it?), where I was just coming round, and had the
satisfaction of telling her the news. I cannot help suspecting that
her case may have been wrongly diagnosed, and

that the splanchnic
ganglion and solar plexus are really the seat of the evil. If so,
the treatment has been entirely at fault.</p>

<p>"I shall most likely be back to-morrow, so keep your congrats. for
me, old chap. No time for a letter. Love from us all to yourself and
Mrs.&nbsp;J. B.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I reopen this (which I wrote late last night) to say that
Miss N., so far from having acquired a horror of the water (as is
usual in such cases), talks of 'swimming over the ground' if the
weather clears. I fear she is incorrigible."</p>

<h4>WILLIAM DE MORGAN'S SOMEHOW GOOD</h4>

<p>After years of separation from his wife, the hero, during a complete
suspension of memory and loss of identity, accidentally finds
shelter in her home. This situation seems very simple, but the
developments are far from simple, and form a story of complicated
motives and experiences which holds the reader closely.</p>

<p>An almost grown-up daughter, ignorant of the situation, heightens
the tension of the plot, and furnishes her share of two charming
stories of young love.</p>

<p>"Somehow Good" is, in the unanimous opinion of the publishers'
readers, an advance upon anything of Mr.&nbsp;De Morgan's yet publisht.
$1.75.</p>

not to mention the "hired girl," in New England country life. $1.25
net; by mail, $1.33.</p>

<p class="size90">"The obvious friendliness of the little book was immediately
disarming. It is leisurely, restful, delightful. Throughout runs a
vein of gentle humor, of spontaneity, of unaffected enthusiasm, of a
spirit keenly alive to beauty and eager to share its
delights."&mdash;<i>Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>

<h4>COMMENTS OF BAGSHOT</h4>

<p>By <span class="smcap">J. A. Spender</span>, editor of "The Westminster Gazette."

<p>Delightful comments upon a great range of subjects, including

"Poverty," "The Needy and the Greedy," "Women's Morality," etc.</p>

<p class="size90"><i>The Spectator</i> (London)&mdash;"While affording the easiest of reading,
nevertheless touches deep issues deeply and fine issues finely. Not
only thinks himself, but makes you think ... wise and witty....
Whether dealing with death and immortality, or riches and Socialism,
he always contrives to be pungent and interesting and yet urbane,
for there is no attempt either at flashy cynicism or cheap
epigram.... We advise our readers to read carefully the admirable
passage about Socialism and Bagshot's defence of Aristotle's
'magnificent man.'"</p>

various actual examples&mdash;Our Com&eacute;die Humaine&mdash;The Slain That Are Not
Numbered.</p>

<p class="size90"><i>Boston Transcript</i>&mdash;"A freshness and piquancy wholly delightful....
Opens fresh doors into delightful thoughts and fancies."</p>

<p class="size90"><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>&mdash;"Some of these essays are among the best
in the English language."</p>

<p class="size90"><i>Chicago Record-Herald</i>&mdash;"Considered in connection with countless
other excellent works of the crowded literary season it resembles
'an oasis green in deserts dry.'"</p>
